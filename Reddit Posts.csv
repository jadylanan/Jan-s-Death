"Sun, Sep 11, 2022, 9:00:09 AM Coordinated Universal Time","Daily Questions Megathread (September 11, 2022)","Ask about anything about the game that doesn't necessarily require a dedicated thread.

That is, if your question can be answered rather quickly/without significant difficulty (e.g. ""Can my phone run this game?""), ask here. If you think your question can contribute to some constructive discussions (e.g. ""What do you think of Amber's combat efficiency? Here's my opinion.""), make a particular post with the ""discussion"" flair.

Other megathreads:

Weekly Friend Request Megathread - Find some friends!

Weekly Gacha and Drops Megathread - The thread where you can share the results of your gacha rolls and lucky drops.

Weekly Team/Character Building Megathread - Ask about team-building or Character-building!

Has been happening for a while and the only way to stop it is to turn the game off and pray it doesn't start over.

Any ideas are welcome I'm just tired of turning on and off the game.

Edit 2: Thanks for the help everyone. I seem to have identified the problem, it appears to be related to my PC overheating. In hindsight it made sense since it's been happening more the past two months in the summer heat and there's also the fact that I can hear my PC's dying breath every time I launch the game.

"Sun, Sep 11, 2022, 7:12:01 PM Coordinated Universal Time",Abyss Teams and Builds,"So...I'm a genshin player and like lots of genshin players I pull for characters to clear spiral abyss....

I'm ar43, started my account in late 2.4 but only got serious and started actually playing in 2.6. When i first started, I thought zhongli was unbearably good looking so i pulled on his banner in 2.5. Lost to keqing at 17 pity and was confused why i didn't get zhongli 😅. Looking back, i'm glad i lost to keqing, especially at such early pity because she's such a fun character and carried me through early game. Then venti banner came along and I just HAD to get him. I saw a clip of him using is elemental burst to suck up slimes plus i was doing the mondstat archon quest at the time so i decided that i just had to get him. This is when I started actually playing. I started farming primos and luck have it i got him at 36 pity :DDD

needless to say i was stoked and i swore on my life that i was gonna start really grinding genshin.

Venti hard carried me more than keqing and those two would end up forming the base of my teams. So in the second half of 2.6, I ended up deciding to pull for ayaka after watching a lot of guides on youtube about her. I got lucky AGAIN and got her at 48 pity and won the 50/50.

From there, I started working on abyss teams at ar35.

I pulled zhongli recently and what I'm planning is a ayaka freeze team comp and a keqing aggravate comp.

keqing/yanfei/collei/zhongli

ayaka/xingqiu/rosaria/venti

I'm just a few more story quests away from ar45, so once I get there, I will be farming artifact domains like crazy to upgrade my characters.

I have a few questions on the rotations of both teams and how to play them effectively.

I was told by some friends who are higher ar and also run a freeze team to first rosaria skill/burst to activate her passives and apply cryo, then venti skill then burst to swirl cryo, then xingqiu skill into the enemies in venti burst then xingqiu burst before ayaka does her stuff.

Should I charged attack with ayaka first or directly use her skill then burst?

Will swirling hydro instead of cryo give a more consistent freeze?

Should I run nobless on rosaria or xinqiu or should i run emblem on xinqiu and BS on rosaria?

What do I do after venti burst and ayaka burst ends? Is it just keep normal attacking and using skill until everyone's bursts are up again?

Because xingqiu is a normal/charged attack oriented support, should I do more charged attacks with ayaka? Or should I pull for kokomi for better hydro application?

I chose rosaria because her passives give more crit rate and her burst is a great source of damage and cryo application, but because it will take time to master a rotation, should i switch her for diona for shields and healing in case my characters are on life support?

😅😅 sorry for so many questions.

Now on to keqing aggravate team. For the record, I have no idea how to play this team. help.

Common sense tells me to always zhongli shield first, then collei skill and burst for dendro application, then keqing skill, burst, charged attack, etc. But where does yanfei, my sub dps come in? Or does she not even belong in this team comp? I really like her playstyle and pyro and dendro deal good amounts of damage, so I would like to include her in my teams.

Would it be good to put xingqiu in this team and just pull for kokomi instead?

I'm still trying do decide if I should build a hybrid zhongli or just plain shield bot? I have the jade spear that I could put on him but I want to pull for xiao on his next re-run.

I want to have everything finalized before i start farming for artifacts :)))

I don't think that is fun nor engaging to force the player to use a team that he/she did not built, it's quite the opposite.

My experience, even though i completed the trials up to date on gold, was very clunky. I don't own half of the 5* characters that are given to me, i don't know the full sinergy of the team made, or in some cases the full extent of what their skills can do, so i just passed the trial smashing buttons and taking pictures.

I understand that they probably do not let you use your personal teams because there is a chance that some comps could stomp the trials with the supersense skill effect (though i don´t believe this would be a bad thing, players should be rewarded for building the best teams for every situation).

I believe events like this either should give you the option to play with your own team (just like they always had in the past), or at least give you a selection of 2 or 3 teams, so there is less chance that you feel alienated from the characters you are using.

Maybe im just and old man yelling at clouds, i don't know.

What was your experience?

I’ve been running Kequeen C2, ZL, XQ, Collei c2, Fischl

All LVL 70 except for Collei who’s 20 and Kequeen who’s 80

All important Talent LVL 6s except Collei

Most have lvl 70 weapons some 50 and Kequeen 80- not the best weapons for the characters but alright ones

None have good sets except ZL, and all artifacts including ZLs r doodoo

As for why all the stats r all over the place, this is my third week so I haven’t had enough time to farm all the materials but I plan on using the rest of my condensed for that

"Sat, Sep 10, 2022, 8:47:03 PM Coordinated Universal Time",For which reasons are you crowning your characters?,"As the title say's: Why do you crown a character? For the meta? You're Waifu/Husbando? Because you like their personality or playstyle? Do you triple crown them or do you let talents at a lower level. Or do you like to combine multiple reasons for a criteria to crown a certain character? Are you more picky or the whatever type? And at the end which characters have you crowned and why?

For my case: I am really picky which character to crown, i must like their looks, personality and most important the gameplay.

I crowned my Raiden 2x because i like her and relate to her, she's my dps and all time favorite character, she has good dps output and support capabilitys.

Next in the row i have Kujou Sara, a character i never tought i end up liking, but her loyality to the Shogun, her playstyle and her being represent in the idori festival event let her really grow on me also she is kind of Raidens Signature support. Currently her skill has 1 crown and her Burst will get one when i get enough elegance books & mora.

The next character is Yelan. I tried her in the Previous Trail event Trial and i had so much fun playing her, that I must pull for her, even tho i first didnt really wanted her and the thing i liked the most about her was the jacket (i still really like the jacket) and that Yanfei was on her Banner) She came home early, and i ended up benching Yanfei because ""my sub dps did more damage then my dps"" now she is one of my favorite characters and double crowned. I kind of want to triple crown her because her NA is not completly useless but i can't do this if Raiden isn't

And last character is Mona: I waited 8 moths till i finally got Mona for loosing a 50/50 on Klee's banner. At that day i had a odd feeling that i could get finally my Mona so i pulled on Klee's banner (i wouldnt had mind getting Klee) so i gone for it and got my Mona like 1-2 weeks after she already had her crown even tho i hate the mondstadt book domain and i usually avoid going there (Hello Bennett with Level 11 Burst and Jean my ever first main with Level 6 Skill) I wanted her for so long and she is actually the only character on this list i wanted since i started and i liked since i have seen her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/xazm50/for_which_reasons_are_you_crowning_your_characters/,froeschengenshin,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

"Sat, Sep 10, 2022, 5:09:39 PM Coordinated Universal Time",Tabletop Genshin Impact,"So aa group of friends and I recently began a little project on trying to create a ttrpg system to play out a genshin styled game in. Systems like Fate do exist which can in part get the feel for it - but this was a chance to put some game design notes we've been learning into practice so the challenge was accepted.

I'm writing this post up mainly to get an idea on what some things people would like to see in such a ttrpg would be - and a couple thoughts on the following basic principles we've got in mind for how the system is getting designed.

Character advancement follows a feat system. Feats are used to improve your capabilities with a given weapon type, gain new techniques for how to use your vision, or improve your general capabilities in other areas.

You aren't restricted in your weapon usage, though using weapons without investment will obviously be weaker than using those you've invested in.

The combat system is aiming to be fairly dynamic and open for strategic movement/placement.

weapon themes have been kinda developed already with the following:

Claymore - specialized in high melee damage with some aoe potential to clear a route through a horde.

Polearm - lower general damage for melee, but built on mobility and precision for increased critical aspects. Also improved reach over the other melee options allowing a more cautious play style.

Sword - your all rounder, decent vs small groups or 1 on 1, better defensive options than polearm but less mobile. More mobile than claymore generally, but lower raw offense.

Catalyst - very modular and reliant on various feats to really build into a particular niche. Particularly focused more so on applying elements for reactions compare to raw damage, or exploiting elemental weaknesses. We do have a physical option in development. Very much focused to be a combo weapon

Bow - high crit ranged weapon meant to help deal with key foes from a safe distance. More mobile than catalyst but less so than polearm.

☆ ☾ CHAPTERS

00:43 Thunderclap Fruitcore
Electro regisvine can be found on the top right corner of the Sumeru map, near the Statue of the 7 and with a tp right in front of the boss if you have that unlocked. When beating it, if a yellow flower spawns it means the shield is in it's head. If a purple flower spawns, then the shield will be in it's roots.
Use a cryo or pyro bow character to beat this boss easily.




01:32 Electro Gemstones
You should have those from defeating electro bosses, but if you don't simply go to the alchemy table and convert it from any other gem (change by clicking on the recipe icon) using azoth dust.




01:54 Eremite's Drops
The eremites are across the whole map but the easiest way to farm their drops is clearing out their fortresses. You can find any of the eremite's fortresses as a small green dot in the map. There are 8 fortresses in total and they also unlock a secret quest once you clear all of them out so it's a great way to farm and get some extra chests.




02:28 Teaching of Ingenuity
The domain is fairly easy to clear, max level is 2 of the new ruin guards enemies. It has an elemental dmg bonus so bring any dps that is not physical dmg and you should be fine. National team clears this in seconds.




02:59 Bloodjade Branch from Azhdaha
If you are new or not AR40 yet, you can unlock azhdaha by doing zhongli's second story quest (historian antique second act). Azhdaha takes 2 different element forms during the battle, these elements will be shown in the domain's door being either pyro+electro or cryo+hydro. Bring a shield (diona, thoma, zhongli...) or a very good healer (kokomi, shinobu) to be able to defeat him because he deals continuous damage every time he changes form, to any character that doesn't have a shield.




04:43 Kalpalata Lotus Farm Route
I have shared in the video my lotus farm route, but if you'd like to read instead of watch then i recommend going to any interactive map and activate only the lotus and you should be able to find them easily. They are mostly in the walls or near bodies of water.

This is one of the worst, most unfun experiences I've had in a game in years. My real question tho is, if this is supposed to be endgame content why is it available at AR 20??? Why are you encouraged to go in so you can get Xiangling but then IMMEDIATELY get walled like Mihoyo pulled a fast one on you. I really really do not understand the logic behind this.

Which now that I think about it has been my experience a lot in this game

Kinda humorous that the little with the highest damage output and most reckless nature is the only one without any kind of healing ability. It does make sense for her character but still kinda sad her being left out of the giant mess of healing that the other littles make when combined.

Either that or the rest of them HAD to pick up on the healing to compensate for her path of destruction.

Ok, now a question for the stranger things fans, if the littles were the Hawkins kids, who'd be the Genshin version of Steve? Honestly my vote would have to be Jean.

Like to encourage players to build critical damage and critical rate on their healers instead of just using HP% which is kinda lazy in my humble opinion.

This could possibly ""nerf"" (wouldn't change) overpowered healers like Kokomi who is the premium healer (can't crit) right now and would make other healers like Qiqi or Diona a better option to push them further and give them a buff.

I feel like this would be a good addition because it wouldn't nerf any characters but instead push other ones back into the meta and make people grind for more artifacts to get critical rate/damage instead of just HP%.

For those whose first language is English, do you have the same ""translate-y"" feeling when you play Genshin Impact in English? Can you immediately tell that the scripts of the quests were translated from Mandarin (or at least, East Asian-y)?

Genshin Impact might be one of the best translated game I have seen so far, with professional translators who truly makes an effort to preserve (or should I say, recast) the idioms and cultural traditions that underlays the text, so I am curious about this question.

(Fun Fact: Although being a Chinese game, I feel that the Mandarin scripts itself actually has quite a few Japanese language traits, such as ""果然还是..."", ""...的呢"", or ""振作一点""，these phrases commonly appears in Mandarin subtitles of Japanese anime.

Anemo + geo swirl but sand (also give dendro swirl)

Ice and geo don’t react

My ideas for new reactions:

pyro + geo on enemies causes liquefy doing small damage over time and a small defence down (geo first does more damage). On structures it turns them offensive making geo structures do constant damage to those around but halving there duration.

hydro + geo causes stuck which reduces movement massively but doesn’t stop attacks if then hit by pyro the hardened reaction happens where there basically frozen and there element resistance increases but physical hits are double but the first physical hit will break of the hardened mud. On structures it will weaken and shorten duration but also increase aoe or range.

dendro + geo fertilise basically geo quicken

electro + geo could be a reworked crystalise where u get increased energy recharge (this is based of the fact that electricity doesn’t do anything to rocks or earth and it basically absorbs the electricity).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/xb1qcm/every_element_can_take_advantage_of_reactions_to/,Ivy389,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

Im in around 30 pity

If Ventis Banner comes in 2 months as speculated for a guaranteed 5 star I need 60 wishes which is one wish a day in the two months

I have not completed all of sumerus quest so I still have primos available from there if it helps I have three of the ""The rythmm that reveals"" quests remaining

And from daily commissions in the two months that already 20 wishes which is a total of 50

(AO constantly takes the L lmao)

Like it's getting predictable these days. The fatui seem to be the core of every single issue except stuff related to the traveler's missing sibling.

Like I want a group to put the fatui in its place once in a while or at least go toe to toe against them.

Wouldn't it be great if we actually teamed up WITH (maybe once) the fatui to fight an immediate danger? Idk I'm kind of hoping natlan would be really into war and battles and start causing trouble for multiple parties.

I feel like we need another group dangerous elites. They could be wildcards or organised with a clear goal in mind.

The way things are now, not a single group in Teyvat can stand against the harbingers. If we don't include the archons or if we have the archons fight one another, then the fatui can pretty much destroy any country. What hope does Inazuma have if all the harbingers and their subordinates who probably all have delusions decide to invade? Knights of favonius? They'd all be destroyed. Sure Liyue have their very powerful adepti but we can assume Snezhnaya has their own non-human guardians.

I just wish that another group of badasses show up down the line. The fatui is starting to get old imo :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/xb1fga/anyone_else_want_something_other_than_the_fatui/,casual_catgirl,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

"Fri, Sep 09, 2022, 2:23:18 AM Coordinated Universal Time",[CN Genshin history]The start of Genshin copy Zelda drama was wild,"Well, actually, Chinese Genshin players are living a hard life on Chinese internet. People are abusing Chinese Genshin players everywhere on internet and even created a dirty word OP yuanpi（原批） in Chinese to abuse Chinese Genshin players which means Genpussy as I translated . P or pi in Chinese slang means pussy， it’s a dirty word. And recently, some anti-genshin or mihoyo persons started to call Global Genshin players overseas-OP too. So, where`s that words OP came from? And why they are so hate of Genshin Impact and its players? Let me tell u the whole stories.

Hi, Im 8 eggs. I am a Chinese gamer and I would like to tell u about Chinese game news and communities reactions. If u r interested in how Chinese gamers thinks or Chinese game companies, just follow my channel.

Well, as u may know, there was a drama about Genshin Impact copy Zelda BOTW in China when they released their first trailer.

And things started from here. Genshin Impact and its Chinese players starts their dark ages until now.

So, in 2019, Mihoyo posted their first Genshin trailer on Chinese website Bilibili.




Then few hours later, there were several comparing videos were pop up. And as a Bilibili content creator, I think the datas of this video is kind of sus. For example, If u look at the ratio between views and likes. Its quite unreasonable. Cause it means not many people like this video. But many people shared it out to other platforms. So, that’s why they only got high shared but low likes. So, it’s a totally drama making video. And I know youtube got a lot of comparing videos too. May be people like to watch this kind of video on youtube. But, in Chinse community, comparing videos sometimes refers to u think one game copied another, depends on different situations.




With those comparing videos, lots of paid troll, or water army（水军） in Chinese, which means these accounts or people are hired to attack something with organized, They were rushing into Genshin official QQ group chats, its a Chinese chat app or weibo, Which is Chinese twitter to attack Genshin. And there were also some reports or articles poped up for attacking Genshin, Calling Genshin as BOTW clone. And mihoyo no shame and so on.

Then, things started to became out of control.




There is an anime content creator on bilibili who is called fanshi. He got over 4million subscribers. And he was also made a video sponsored by Genshin and promoted Genshin Impact in his video. Then, those so called Zelda players by themselves started to attack this content creator.




At the end, fanshi was so annoying and afraid of those black mails or attacks. So, he made a livestream to apologized to those anti- genshin or mihoyo persons or those so called Zelda players. In the livestream, his girlfriend even cried, kind of sad actually, and he finally deleted his promotion video for genshin. Those guys are not just simply blackmailed this content creator they even abusing him with his parents ，attacking his family by dirty words. Kind of crazy and wild TBH.

Then, there were another 2 anime content creators poped up.




One is called knife and poisons. 190thousands subscribers




The other one is called bottle kun 152 who got 3.5milions subscribers.

What they did? Well, they said, with genshin, Chinese game industry will be ruined and today is the darkest day in Chinese gaming history! Genshin Impact is the main reason why Chinese developers can`t make a famous 3A games. Because they ruined and misled Chinese game industry!

Well, now, we all know that day is not the darkest day of Chinese gaming history, Instead, it’s the lightest day of Chinese gaming history, right? There is finally a Chinese game successfully get into western market and earn a lot. First time, as a Chinese old gamer I feel so proud of Genshin and Mihoyo. So, which means, they became clowns, and their words became a famous memes in CN genshin community. like we always call genshin a darkest game like that.

Meanwhile, the internet violation of Genshin was still continuing.




There was a female anime content creator called wumiao Mania, She made a video talk about genshin. She did not criticize genshin in her video like others did. She was so objective when she was talking about genshin in her video. But, those anti-genshin guys still attacked her just because she did not criticize Genshin copy Zelda as others did. So they think she is a Genshin fan girl.

And its not the end of their madness yet.




Then, there was another content creator on bilibili called Fanshuai who got 400 thousands subscribers. And he is also a former game UI designer.




He wrote an article to analyze if Genshin`s UI copied Zelda. And he said in the intro. He will not deny the large amounts of similarities between Genshin and Zelda especially end game contents similarity. And he said he is quite understand why Zelda players hate Genshin.

So, basically, I don’t think he is a genshin fanboy or something. But, those water army or aniti groups did not think so. They started to call this content creator Genshin fanboy too and attacking him.

So, u might think that they only attack CN content creators?




There was a Japanese artist posted a tweet said there are a lot of people are expecting Genshin all over the world, so be more confident, Chinese.

After that those anti groups started to attack this artist too.




And its not the end yet. They even attacked those voice actors who were related or promoted Genshin Impact. I choose not to translated those comments. Cause its too dirty, when U see those mosaic, U probably know whats going on right?

And there was a really interested thing.




Tencent Anime bilibili official account posted a screenshot and said I can`t go to Chinajoy TMR. Cause I am afraid that I don’t recognize which is Zelda`s boosh. Well, tencent, as always. That’s what I would say.

And yes, Tencent is running TOF global server. And if u guys are interested in tencent. I can make another video talk about it.

Well, I don’t want to make this video too long. So we have to end it here. That’s the start of CN Genshin history. I will continue in next video.

"Mon, Sep 05, 2022, 10:16:24 PM Coordinated Universal Time",Early Nahida kit references in game data,"So after seeing BLANK's leak I randomly decided to look up if there's anything already in the 3.0 data, and surprisingly there is!

There are references to some animations in a file called PhotographCheckAnimatorDataData, probably controlling... the Kamera? Idk, but anyway here they are:

Nahida_ElementalArt_BS
Nahida_ElementalArt_Click
Nahida_ElementalArt_Click_AS
Nahida_ElementalArt_Move
Nahida_ElementalArt_Loop
Nahida_ElementalArt_Hold_AS
Nahida_ElementalArt_Hold
Nahida_ElementalBurst
Nahida_ElementalBurst_AS


Click and Hold animations imply the skill will have press and hold variations.
The Loop animation implies that the hold skill can be held statically for a while, either aiming like Fischl's or Keqing's or Itto's, or waiting like Beidou's or Yunjin's.
The Move animation implies that the skill will let you move freely during its duration: the only other skills with a Move animation in the data are Mona and Ayaka's alternate sprints and Fischl's burst.

As this data was left in 2 whole patches in advance it is very very subject to change, but there are also references to Nilou, Cyno and Candace's skills and they match what can be seen in the beta (Candace's skill having several charge levels, Cyno's skill behaving like Rosaria's, Cyno's burst being a ""mode"", Nilou's skill being a dance with 3 steps) so at the very least it's likely not random.

By the way I'm not sure the ""Reliable"" flair is correct but I chose it here because I don't see anything more applicable and it's a 100% verifiable datamine result.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/x6t0wj/early_nahida_kit_references_in_game_data/,viliml,2,0,0,Genshin_Impact_Leaks

Initially, travelers will get a new item upon reaching a new nation, which is for new methods of traveling, but there's too much work for adding new animations so the plan got cancelled😥

Geo Steps/Stairs : Double jump

Electro Boat/Raft : Surfing

Dendro Rope : Grappling hook (And the overworld is now an action game)

Hydro Fin : Diving

Pyro Cannon : Launches into air

"Fri, Sep 02, 2022, 2:49:10 PM Coordinated Universal Time",🧂 Kusanali Mains 3.1 Beta Theorycrafting First Impressions and Q&A Thread 🧂,"Hey Hey Everyone! For those unaware, I'm Drak, Head of Theorycrafting for Kusanali Mains (KSM). We are a community hub for Theorycrafting, known also as the Sumeru Akademiya Library of Theory (SALT).

For those of you unfamiliar with us, here's some of our recent contributions and some details on our staff:

We have people who have made extensive calculators for several units, for example Raiden, Eula, Yelan, Tighnari, and Nilou.

We have the original authors and owners of several of the top guides on KQM, such as Hutao, Raiden, Yelan, and Xiangling.

We've recently done several guides, such as our Quick Dendro guide (which is the origin point of most of the now playerbase-accepted Dendro-related TC terms such as ""fridging"" for example), as well as our own original in-progress guides for Tighnari, Collei, DMC, Kokomi, Itto, and more in the future.

We are also in close collaboration with several mains servers when it comes to their representative character's guides, and are at this moment also assisting in updating the western Genshin community's thus far biggest and most well-known Lisa, Diluc, and Xiao guides.

⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤ ⋆✧🌺✧⋆ ⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤

We've had some talks with the mods here to set up a Q&A Thread for you all to come ask your questions on the Units and Weapons within 3.1 for how they might lay out from a TC perspective.

If everything goes well there should be another coming at the end of beta, to give another opportunity to clarify what might have changed and what to expect with live version. Hopefully there will as well be more at both the start and end of other betas going forward.

First of all, I must absolutely state:

This is Beta, things can change. Do not take what we say here as gospel, and watch out for how any adjustments might shift things as beta progresses.




Now, lets lay out some resources to check out:

Got a question about a mechanic or how a team looks in practice? We might have answered it already either here, on our subreddit r/KusanaliMains under the flair ""SALT Finding"", or at https://Discord.gg/kusanali under the #findings channel.

If you want our help with anything outside of the span of the 3.1 Beta, feel free to come stop by in our Help section on the discord above. We have plenty of Theorycrafters and Help Staff willing to assist to your specific needs.

If you need help figuring out Dendro, our website is newly launched at https://kusanalimains.com and our Dendro guide has been migrated to it. Character focused guides will be on their way there soon so keep an eye out.

⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤ ⋆✧🌺✧⋆ ⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤

Now lets get into an overview of 3.1 to our current knowledge:

Check out the Nilou Mastersheet for info on Weapons, Constellations, and Artifacts at tinyurl.com/nilou-mastersheet for more info.

Check out more info on Weapon and Artifact calcs at https://tinyurl.com/cyno-calcs.

More exploration for Candace soon.




⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤ ⋆✧🌺✧⋆⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤⏤

All that said, lets lay out some ground rules and answer some common questions:

Should I pull x or y unit/weapon?

Your account, your choice. All we can do is lay out what units do, what they are strong at, and what they struggle with. We will never tell you your Waifu/Husbando is bad, or that you are wrong to not pull a unit just because they are popular.

Avoid questions on trying to 'rank' where a unit fits within the meta. Beta is far too early to really make any conclusions on anything that specific.

Thanks to [TF Dragon God] Noir#1966 and vinsette#0293 for helping write up the character impressions, as well as ◇ MTL#7777 for designing our infographics.

"Sun, Aug 28, 2022, 6:29:46 PM Coordinated Universal Time",Clarifications on private server leaks,"Recently there has been a spike in private server based leaks and I see a lot of confusion as to what's reliable from them and what isn't so here I aim to clarify some misconceptions. As always take everything with grains of salt, everything is subject to change.In this post I will not tell you how to get into private servers, you can google it yourself, it's not that difficult although be aware that sharing beta content is putting you at risk of getting DMCA striked. So do what you will at your own risk.What isn't reliableSimply put everything. Private servers are all derived from the same open source project, this means that the code can be modified to fit whatever you want it to be. Model changes, animation changes are abundant with plenty of examples everywhere. DMG changes are even easier to achieve, for example here my character deals astronomically high numbers however no DMG connects as the level one ~200 hp enemy tanks billions of DMG with no issues.Pause0:000:00SettingsFullscreenInfinite DMG shown, no DMG dealt.This is a fairly cheap trick to do, it can be done to both overvalue or undervalue a character. So DMG numbers from a private server should never be trusted.Constellations and talents can be changed, enabled, disabled despite what the level of the character would indicate.Pause0:000:00SettingsFullscreenC2 without C1You can go on and on and edit anything you want limited only by your abilities as a coder and your understanding of the game's internal mechanics. You aren't just limited to modifying the private server you can go ahead and modify the client as well. With publicly available injection cheat programs you can make your characters repeat the last attack multiple times making it seem like it deals more DMG than it actually should deal.What you can trustAs much as private servers can be modified to push any agenda the leaker wishes, they can also be used for a lot of good and productive things. By default private servers are as accurate as the implemented passives and talents are. Most talents and passives work fine. If something doesn't work reliable leakers won't post anything about it or they will mention that the specific thing doesn't work in the environment they are using to test.Having access to a private server also allows you to gather a lot more information than otherwise possible with just data mining. For example you can harness real time hit logs from the server drastically improving accuracy of calculations and frame counts.Pause0:000:00SettingsFullscreenTry counting the electro-charged manuallyReactions are accurate and correctly implemented as they're mostly handled client-side. The DMG each individual reaction might not be fully accurate to the DMG you should expect in official servers however this doesn't make the hit counts any less accurate. This does not mean that they're impossible to alter, only more difficult to do so.ConclusionDo not instantly dismiss information you see just because it's a private server, if the source is reliable with a good track record and no people are correcting them you can feel pretty safe in trusting their current information.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/x02d69/clarifications_on_private_server_leaks/,RapsyJigo,2,0,0,Genshin_Impact_Leaks

Most details are already indicated in the update maintenance preview.

This post will contain most additional details not yet included in the update maintenance preview.

——〓New System in Sumeru〓——

Tree of Dreams, Vanarana

A mystic plant that grows in the heart of the forest. Seems to be sentient. Nurture it with Dendro Sigils collected in adventures to obtain the treasures of the forests.

Tree of Dreams, Vanarana System Unlock Criteria: Complete the World Quest ""Trees and Dreams""

Sumeru Reputation System

Sumeru Reputation Unlock Criteria: Complete Archon Quest ""Chapter III: Act II - The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings: Denouement""

By interacting with certain NPCs in Sumeru, you will be able to accept requests to complete and increase your Reputation. As your Reputation Level increases, you will unlock various Reputation Rewards!

Expeditions, Daily Commissions, and other new content will also be added in Sumeru.

Sumeru Daily Commissions Unlock Criteria:

Complete Archon Quest Chapter III: Act II ""The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings: Denouement""

Complete the World Quest ""Adventure Takes Courage!""

After completing Archon Quest Chapter III: Act II ""The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings: Denouement,"" the World Quest ""Adventure Takes Courage!"" will be available at 04:00 (Server Time).

In addition, there will be new Fishing Points and ""Radiant Spincrystals"" in Sumeru.

——〓New Domains〓——

Domain of Forgery: Tower of Abject Pride

◇ It is said that the deserts were once home to three sage-kings, one of whom remained lovely and wise till the very end. They parted ways eventually for the sake of the paradise they sought in their hearts. This place is called a ""tower,"" but in truth was the temporary residence of one of these people when they were building that earthly paradise. If one stretches the past back even further, it was once a small shrine built to avoid the wind and the sand.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 22 or above OR complete the Archon Quest Prologue: Act II ""For a Tomorrow Without Tears""

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain Weapon Ascension Materials.

Domain of Mastery: Steeple of Ignorance

◇ In the ancient past, man-made towers that could touch the skies were built all across the land. Though human hearts flowed downward, their souls aspired toward the high heavens. These towers would always fall, or collapse under their own weight and plummet into the depths. However, if one were to look at things at a grander scale, the heavens and earth are as one — no direction is truly different from another.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 22 or above OR complete the Archon Quest Chapter I: Act I ""Of the Land Amidst Monoliths""

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain Talent Level-Up Materials.

Domain of Blessing: Spire of Solitary Enlightenment

◇ In ancient times, this was a great and beautiful place, seemingly made to bless the children of humanity. But the arrow of heaven would descend, making mountains out of flat land and burying the ancient capitol beneath the hills.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 22 or above OR complete the Archon Quest ""Prologue: Act III - Song of the Dragon and Freedom""

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain artifacts in the ""Deepwood Memories"" and ""Gilded Dreams"" sets.

Domain: Under the Umbrella's Shade

◇ The poets have it that spores, like trees, are connected to each other, and that all fungal beings in the world share a single dream. At the end of that dream, the spores would take on the forms of all things, and that all things would return to the beginning — return to being one — and that there would never again be boundaries. But the evolution of Fungi into sentient, locomotive beings was not something that happened in such primordial times. Regardless, this place has become fertile soil for Fungi to thrive.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 20 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems, Dendro Sigils, and more.

Domain: Fragment of Childhood Dreams

◇ This was once a dreamland paradise of a child of the forest, constructed based on how other children would describe the woods. In their memories, the forest was incredibly vast, much like the world itself. The forest was also immensely deep, just like fate itself. Although the dimensions of the world and the true depth of destiny would ultimately disappoint, the fantasy of them endures deep within this nursery.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 24 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems, Dendro Sigils, and more.

Domain: The Dark Valley

◇ Legend has it that the moon once had a face. Under the fierce moon's face, like a white bow, the paths through the forest labyrinth would bring lost people to jade and amber dreams. This forest labyrinth has ceased to exist for hundreds of years — and yet even a hundred thousand winters must seem like a day in the garden of dreams.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 28 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems, Dendro Sigils, and more.

Domain: The Coordinates of Sun and Rain

◇ According to the legends, the goddess who had command over plants would summon forth a spirit of timely rains, whose name was Varuna, or ""water and sky."" These same legends say that the now-deceased forest king used hedges and streams, and the children of the pomegranate used dreams and illusions to create a labyrinth as deep and intricate as the very roots of trees themselves, to defend the secret of sun and rain.

◇ Unlock Criteria: Reach Adventure Rank 32 or above and fulfill certain criteria.

◆ Challenge the Domain to obtain rewards such as Primogems, Dendro Sigils, and more.

——〓Elemental Reactions〓——

Catalyze

When creatures are affected by Electro and Dendro, the Quicken reaction will occur, which will render them Quickened.

When a Quickened entity is attacked by Electro or Dendro, they will trigger Aggravate and Spread respectively, which will increase DMG taken.

Bloom

When creatures are affected by Hydro and Dendro, the Bloom reaction will occur, generating a Dendro Core.

Only a certain number of Dendro Cores can exist at the same time. If new ones are created once this limit is reached, or if the duration of the existing Dendro Cores ends, the pre-existing Dendro Cores will explode, dealing AoE Dendro DMG.

When Dendro Cores come into contact with Pyro, they will trigger Burgeon, causing even greater AoE Dendro DMG. When Dendro Cores come into contact with Electro, they will trigger Hyperbloom, and transform into homing Sprawling Shots.

——〓New Event〓——

""Graven Innocence"" Event: Take part to invite ""Sprout of Rebirth"" Collei (Dendro)

During the event, complete the quest ""The Unappreciated Carving"" to invite the character ""Sprout of Rebirth"" Collei (Dendro). Help the staff in Acara Crafts find assistants and collect inspiration regarding toy-making to obtain Primogems, Crown of Insight, Character Level-Up Materials, Talent Level-Up Materials, and event-exclusive Furnishings, etc.

"Tue, Jul 26, 2022, 8:12:53 PM Coordinated Universal Time",Announcement: New rule regarding external link posts and addition to posting guidelines.,"Hey everyone,

For a while now we have wanted to to improve quality and uniformity of posts. Recently we have had a massive influx of new content, more so than ever, and with it the frequency of low-effort external link posts has increased. Thus we feel it is the right time to introduce some changes.

New rule: No external link posts, any post containing media must be uploaded directly to Reddit when making the post.

The reasons for this new rule are as follows:

We have many users from countries that cannot access certain external sites such as streamable, twitter etc. This rule will mean all users of the subreddit will be able to view all content posted on the subreddit.

Standardizes all posts which makes for a more streamlined browsing experience.

Reduces number of low-effort posts.

Disincentivizes users from rushing to post first resulting in lower quality posts. This was a problem because it discouraged users from taking the time to make a higher quality post uploaded to reddit when someone could just quickly post a link.

In the event someone is unaware of the rules and makes an external link post, we have configured the automod to remove the post and leave a comment notifying the user to upload their post to reddit instead.

For higher quality images or videos, links can be pinned in the comments. For posts that are not videos or images (e.g. google docs spreadsheet), make a text post and include the link in the main body.

Addition to posting guidelines: Time/engagement limit for reposts of higher quality to stay up

In our posting guidelines we allow reposts provided it is of higher quality than the original i.e. better quality video/picture, uploaded to reddit, includes more info, more appropriate title etc.

This is something we enforce regularly on a case by case basis, however there is no limit specified for when reposts are permitted. This is an issue because some users have made higher quality posts but they are posted much later than the initial post which at that point had a lot of discussion and engagement. If we remove the initial post, that discussion is lost and the new post will most likely not receive as much traction/discussion as the leak has already been seen.

For now we have added a time limit of 20 minutes and an engagement limit of 100 comments for reposts to stay up. This means after the initial post reaches 20 minutes or 100 comments (whichever is reached first) reposts of it are not allowed. 20 minutes is ample time for a user to share a better quality post if necessary, and 100 comments is a lot of discussion.

These limits are rudimentary and may be fruitless depending on how active the sub is, so if you think the limits are too high or low or have better suggestions for this please share them!

Also, this will not be a new rule but an addition to the current posting guidelines so there is still room for discretion in exceptional cases.

Since this subreddit serves primarily as a discussion hub and feed for leaks rather than an archive, there needs to be a balance between speed and quality of posts. Right now, we believe the needle swings too far to the former and the aforementioned proposals aim to restore that balance.

If you need further clarification or have any concerns, please let us know in the comments or via modmail. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/w8ts2f/announcement_new_rule_regarding_external_link/,Bobson567,2,0,0,Genshin_Impact_Leaks

"Tue, Jul 26, 2022, 12:40:25 AM Coordinated Universal Time",Tighnari Damage Calculation based on V 3.0 Beta,"The following is a translation of https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv17754507

The original author is Bernardwn https://space.bilibili.com/351841242.

The following are notable regarding Tighnari's V 3.0 beta changes.

Skill effect: after release this skill, charged ATK time is decreased. The reduction is increased from 1.5s to 2.4s.

Passive skill: damage increase from EM is reduced from 0.08% to 0.06%, max possible damage increase is reduced from 80% to 60%.

C6 is added the following: 150% ATK as damage for charged ATK.

Dendro application amount: C0-5 dendro application count from charged ATK reduced from 3 to 2; Skill application count remains 1; Burst application count remains 4.

(These changes are visible in CN version of Honey Impact, but not yet on EN version)

Comment: The about change will greatly affect C0-5 Tighnari's damage timeline. for V2 Beta, optimal choice is fill the 12s timeline with EQZZZZZ (Z probably means charged attack). In V3 beta, some element amount is sacrificed, but only 5s of EQZZZ is required, then one can switch to another character. This will make DMG dealt faster, more agile in use, and improved handiness. C0 Tighnari can enjoy C6 Ganyu's fast shooting. Speaking of teaming, since the on stage time is reduced, and charging time is reduce, the result is less dependent on shield. One can try a team without Zhongli, or a short timeline relay team. However, V3 Tighnari passive skill is nerfed: EM benefit is reduced. The new effect in C6 is equivalent to 1 arrow's bonus damage, which increases C6 charged ATK damage.

The following shows V3 Tighnari's DMG expectation.

Tighnari's charged ATK DMG regarding all constellations

Considering that low constellation Tighnari's charged attack dendro application count is reduced, this will decrease Tighnari's dendro-catalyze charged ATK damage expectation. Also, C6 Tighnari will gain additional damage with ATK, charged ATK's damage expectation is increased.

Tighnari's 5s total damge regarding all constellations

Considering changes regarding Tighnari's elemental skill, now it's more recommended to use 5s short timeline strategy. It can be seen that Tighnari's damage speed is getting a notable increase. While C6 Tighnari may not use 5s short timeline strategy, it is shown here just to compare with other constellations to see the improvement.

Tighnari's damage regarding different weapons

The above is damage expectation chart regarding different weapons. Since dendro-catalyze's portion is reduced in the total damage, Hunter's path has even more advantage compared to other weapons. In the chart, the new Sumeru forgable weapon is included, It can be seen that the Sumeru's forgable bow has higher DPS than the Battle Pass bow. The new forgable bow's effect and refinement reward is as following.

New Sumeru forgable bow. Source: Honey Impact

New Sumeru forgable bow. (refinement) Source: Honey Impact

Tighnari's charged ATK damage regarding different Artifacts

After this change, the difference between the new Gilded Dreams set and Troupe set is further increased. Due to reduction in EM benefit, and increment of burst DMG within total damage, when Tighnari is using artifact other than Gilded Dreams now, the benefit of Dendro DMG Goblet is greater than EM Goblet.

The above is Beta V3.0 Tighnari's DMG expectation. All credit goes to the original author Bernardwn. Please refer to the original article https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv17754507 for more accurate information.

Note:

About Advanced Elemental Reaction Theory (https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Gauge_Unit_Theory) in Dendro-Electro catalyze reaction.

In primary catalyze, Dendro and Electro reacts at 1:1 proportion. After reaction, Electro is consumed, Dendro is seemingly consumed, but actually not. It's converted to ""Catalyze Element"". When the target has Catalyze Element on, it's catalyzed, which is the precondition of ""Electro Catalyze"" and ""Dendro Catalyze"". When Catalyze Element is consumed by other reactions, or decay through time, the target exits catalyze state.

""Electro Catalyze"" and ""Dendro Catalyze"" are in fact, only element application. Electro-Dendro reaction will not consume Catalyze Element, it will only decay through time. 1 Unit of Catalyze Element will decay in about 11 seconds. When Catalyze Element exists, apply Catalyze Element again will refresh it's remaining time.

""Electro Catalyze"" and ""Dendro Catalyze"" have not reaction CD, because Electro-Dendro reaction will not consume Catalyze Element. Therefore, as long as keep applying elements, reaction will goes on forever. Therefore, either ""Electro Catalyze"" or ""Dendro Catalyze"" will not affect the continuation of the other reaction. Each character's each skill have element application CD. In one rotation, Electro or Dendro's application count is therefore the theoretical number of times getting ""Electro Catalyze"" or ""Dendro Catalyze"".

Catalyze Element only reacts with Pyro and Hydro, not with others. Therefore, it's not recommended for Electro-Dendro catalyze team to bring Pyro and Hydro teammates.

Again, all credit goes to the original author Bernardwn. Please refer to the original article https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv17754507 for more accurate information.

"Thu, Jul 21, 2022, 12:42:55 PM Coordinated Universal Time",Details and clarification on dendro reaction mechanics,"I’ve been following and talking to theorycrafters ever since the dendro reactions got leaked. I’m not a theorycrafter myself, I’ve just been trying to help people answer questions about things I understand and there’s evidence of. But apparently, A LOT of people are misunderstanding how the reactions work and are spreading misinformation in this sub. So here is the document made by theorycrafters and testers from kusanali mains listing all the currently tested details regarding dendro reactions:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b9m1hptaZqLHqyMIQji2z8LaDBWsV9K_fpmONU0zAv8/edit?usp=sharing

To sum up some important points:

All dendro reactions scale off the most recent applier’s stats

Burgeon and hyperbloom scale off the EM of the character who applied the electro or pyro element, not the character who created the seed

Reapplying dendro or electro to catalyze aura refreshes the aura and extends the buff time

Bloom and burgeon are the 2 reactions that can both damage enemies and yourself

The seeds generated by bloom need direct elemental application from abilities or attacks to create hyperbloom/burgeon reaction. Abilities DO target seeds. (for some reason, some people believe that skills can’t hit seeds and think that the seeds only need to be in close proximity of enemies affected by elements for further reactions. That is NOT true.)

Not all abilities can hit or prioritise seeds, here are some currently tested abilities:

Beidou’s burst doesn’t jump to seeds

Yelan’s burst doesn’t prioritise seeds

Fischl’s skill can hit seeds, priority unknown yet. Fischl’s A4 can also hit seeds which is extremely good as it has no ICD

Lisa’s burst can hit seeds. If she’s C4 and the enemies or seeds are tightly grouped together (for example with Venti burst), she will have quadratic scaling

Yae’s skill’s random targeting can hit seeds

Ganyu’s burst doesn’t target seeds (obvious since cryo doesn’t react with bloom)

Guoba targets seeds if it’s the closest entity

Childe’s riptide can’t hit seeds

That is everything tested so far regarding the mechanics of dendro reactions. For people interested in more theorycrafting, there is also an analysis of electro DPS with aggravate reactions:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13LhrRO2JH72HB7iWmt6glmEBoex3EGnIY863gVcBL6U/edit?usp=sharing

Do take note that these are very rough calculations for specific characters with the purpose to understand more how aggravate buffs their personal damage. It’s not a comparison of their DPS nor is it a comparison of which teamcomp is the best.

The main findings show that electro will become a lot stronger with the aggravate reaction. Especially Fischl will be buffed significantly. While EM stats will become better on electro characters, most of them still want ATK sands. The 4 piece Ornamental Gold Dream set is good on Fischl and Yae but might not always be better than 2TF/2SR or 4TF with high EM.

Again, these are all conclusions by looking at aggravate alone. Nothing about hyperbloom or team rotations is included. More research needs to be done to see which units and artifacts are the best in specific team comps. I’m sharing this because there have been many questions on this sub asking “is x good in hyperbloom/aggravate team?”, “which team is best for x?”, “is x or y better in this team?” etc. The answer to this is: we don’t have a definitive conclusion yet. Please wait for more testing and research to be done. And as always, everything listed above is still in beta and subject to change.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact_Leaks/comments/w4fr6y/details_and_clarification_on_dendro_reaction/,SKT_T1_Teemo,2,0,0,Genshin_Impact_Leaks

I thought nothing of it and ignored it. When I came back, the game had set me back a few checkpoints. I had to sit through some dialogue and complete a ""Contemplation"" again, although this isn't a big deal for me. When I got to the ""Contemplation"" however, it completely forgot to reset the choices I have chosen previously, so all the options (including the one I need to proceed with the quest) are unclickable. I tried resetting the game and doing the dialogue over and over again, but nothing is working.




If you have trouble visualizing what I am talking about, here is a screenshot of my screen:

On first discovery, three of them (all incorrect options) were clickable. After clicking them, they became gray permanently. Pressing the ""X"" will make you leave this screen, and you will have to sit though the same dialogue to access it again.

so basically I created A Genshin Impact survey for self research purposes on the Genshin impact community and players, I would highly appreciate it if anyone would like to do my small survey and help me in my self research.

you can skip if you really want: {




and just to be clear every question is an important one and not supposed to act as a joke even if it sounds like one I want you to answer it as truthlike as you can.




if you've got a problem with one of the open questions you can write in there that its something you don't want to share or is private to you, and if you've got a problem with answering one of the close ended questions please try to answer it truthlike no one will judge you for it.

}

survey itself should take up to 7 minutes since most of the questions are simple enough to answer.

thank you for your cooperation

I am 100% set on pulling on Nahida when her banner comes up, but I was actually considering to pull on Ganyu or Kokomi to improve my Xinqiu constellation (C2).Problem is: I have an assured 50/50 in 35 pulls (I have 70 wishes already stacked up) since I lost the last one and IDK what is more worth doing. Is it better to just let Xinqiu be and hoard it up for Nahida? Should I pull for C1 Ganyu or a brand new Kokomi hoping he will come along?

It should be worth mentioning that I have a C6 Sucrose, so if I drop her, I have another pull which doesn't suck.

P.S. sorry, English is not my main language, so if there's any mistake, feel free to correct it or ask for more infos. Also, if you wanna give any team building advices, feel free to do so! I always enjoy trying new comps.

I'm also pretty casual, but since I've gotten stuck at the Delusion Factory Archon Quest, I've been trying to strengthen my characters for over 2 weeks between work.

My biggest lack of knowledge relates to artifacts. I can't seem to find any guides that cover anything I could need to know, such as the ranges of stats, (like if I get a 5% Electro Damage goblet, idk if that's good b/c I don't know what the highest percentage possible is) what main stats and substats really mean, and what stats to go for.

I've been searching for something, but nothing I've found fits my needs.

I'd also appreciate any tutorials regarding how to team build, and what type of elements to put together, since I can only seem to find individual character guides.

So if anyone has come across tutorials, preferably videos, that covers these things, it would be greatly helpful if you'd be willing to drop those below.

...or to be more accurate, I'm starting all over again now. Not because I died, but because I reached a point where I needed a Dendro character and my Aether is still Anemo. I have Collei, but since this is a domain there's no way for me to move her into the party while I'm inside.

And it would be one thing if they miHoYo made it clear early on ""Oh, you're gonna be stuck if you have no Dendro people! Look, you can't even advance past the first part without Dendro! You need to leave and come back with either your Collei or after you swing by a Statue Of The Seven.""

But that's not how it works. It allows you to progress 2/3 of the way through, and THEN you find one of those...(I haven't memorized the names of everything here, so go easy on me please) plants that shoots a thing into the air when it's hit with Dendro. You know, one of those things that you can zoom up to if it's in your line of sight and you press T.

""Is it going to save my progress after I leave and come back in?"" I stupidly wondered.

No, it did not.

So, in addition to me having an outlet for my saltiness, I guess let this serve as a warning: don't do this quest without any Dendro people, lest you too become salty.

"Tue, Sep 06, 2022, 9:44:52 PM Coordinated Universal Time",Quest to talk about Genshin Impact Part 15: Astronomy of Genshin Impact's Moon and Earth's rotation.,"This is a small post discussing Genshin Impact lore, and this post is somewhat underwhelming compared to what I posted in the past.

According to Astronomical logic, for The Moon to always be a Full Moon, we are to assume that the Moon's Orbit around the Earth is in the right alignment with the Earth's rotation so that we will always see a full moon in the night. However, this might be problematic when discussing the Earth orbiting around the Sun and how light would touch the Moon then, but for now, assuming the Genshin Impact universe isn't Geo-Centric, this is the best explanation I have.

Furthermore, to account for the Genshin Impact planet's rotation around the sun potentially taking much more than an Earth year, perhaps Genshin Impact takes place in a solar system whose Sun is much more intense than our own, but the Genshin Impact's planet, to make up for the difference of intensity, exists in a habitable zone that's further away from its star.

If this is how Genshin Impact's moon actually behaves, we would assume, then, that when the Planet is on the other side of the Star, there will be a Solar eclipse every day, especially if it stays perfectly in sync with the Earth's rotation in this manner, and the same logic would apply to the other phases of the moon. It could take multiple days, if not years for us to see different phases of the Moon (including solar eclipses) to happen.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/x7msyt/quest_to_talk_about_genshin_impact_part_15/,Commentator289,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

"Wed, Sep 07, 2022, 1:42:03 AM Coordinated Universal Time",Deep Lore Post 2: The Mega Saucer,"For my Deep-lore series, you'll notice that I put the ""Other,"" tag. I did that intentionally because the topics I plan to cover on this series of posts sound too outlandish to not question if I'm being serious or not, and I definitely don't want to make it a, ""Meme,"" flair post, either, as it's lore related.

As of today, I got my phone and decided to watch the Genshin Impact Moon to see if it had phases for my, ""Mini theory."" I looked and saw the beautiful night sky, and as someone who lives where there is heavy light pollution, it's just not something I get to experience in real life.

However, I decided to pan the camera straight upwards.




Without zooming in, you can see this beautiful flower pattern with the stars (in the center of the screen at the very top of the image of this particular screenshot), and arguably, this is going to be very difficult to see when you're playing normally. I could not find a way to enhance the image nor what I want you to see, so zooming in will make somewhat of a blurry mess.




If you personally play the game and look at the very center of the pattern yourself (because naturally screenshots are blurrier than the actual image), you'll see a perfectly circular break in the star light, but furthermore, you'll see this purple glow in the center.

Back in my previous posts, I pointed out:

#1 Time Travelers

#2 Elemental Technologies

#3 Technologies being able to mimic the attacks of Ei, including the ability to shoot lightning down from an unknown source.

#4 The Temples and Robots being far more advanced than the typical civilizations we see in the age Genshin Impact takes place for the average human

#5 Celestia looking suspiciously close to a space ship and what the island would look like underneath

#6 Aether and Lumine traveling across multiple, ""worlds,"" with an unspecified idea for what the phrase, ""world,"" means

and finally #7, the idea that Archons could just be highly spiritually and technologically advanced aliens that fooled humans into thinking they were divine (not the deified humans, but potentially the first Archons to arrive at the planet the setting takes place).




I know that the image presented to show the object itself is blurry, and I agree. I had to stare at it very hard in order to see it. What I drew above is my best representation of what is in the center of the pattern of stars. It can best be seen at midnight in-game time.

At first, I reasoned that Celestia was the Mother Ship of the Archons, as massive as it was, how it's central to the powers of the Archons, and how, if a human wants to be deified, their goal would be to, ""ascend to Celestia."" However, the object in the center of the sky really, ""throws that out the window,"" if you will. Not only is this massive object inconceivably massive, but what's worse is that it seems to be pointing something at the planet, so much so that the center is glowing purple.

If I was a person living in the Genshin Impact world, I would be suffering from existential dread, due to the idea that an unfathomably large object has been floating above me, especially not understanding its intentions. The reason I was so compelled to post this was because the implications of this object seemed to raise my heart-rate a little.

When you study astronomy, you can detect if there's an object somewhere because of its gravitational effect on what is around it, or the idea that it could be blocking out some light, thus being able to be detected. If I'm correct, an unfathomably large space-craft is potentially pointing a super-weapon at the planet we currently reside in. This object is massive enough to leave a circular, ""black spot,"" in the night sky, blocking out the light of distant stars. This object is so massive that it can house trillions of life forms and have its own gravitational pull, and the most terrifying part is, something is glowing from the center, and because it's perfectly flat to our perspective, that means that this glow is being aimed in our general direction, and because we can see the glow in the center just by looking into the night sky, there's copious amounts of power involved to make this center glow. I zoomed in the best I could and what is in the center isn't stars, but something intentionally shaped, and energy is being heavily concentrated in the center. Should they attack the Earth, it wouldn't destroy a country or make a hole in the Earth, but just evaporate the planet altogether.




I'm aware I could be wrong, and if you would, please take this post with a grain of salt, especially because we could potentially have better ""zoom in,"" some day to enhance the images we're seeing in the night sky.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/x7s5rb/deep_lore_post_2_the_mega_saucer/,Commentator289,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

"Tue, Sep 06, 2022, 4:01:57 PM Coordinated Universal Time","Quest to Talk about Genshin Impact part 14: Mona the Time Traveller, and distortions in time-space","An unfortunate trend in Genshin Impact from what I noticed is that Aether gets lied to often, and even in the newer dialogues, it seems as though Aether has reached the point where he's starting to get passive aggressive when he detects another lie.

Mona, as she explains, is an astrologist who tells the future, and a well-renowned one, ""at that."" However, simply looking at her special attack, no one can convince me that this is purely magic, as she clearly threw a device shooting water as well as a hologram more advanced than 21st century technology. It's important to understand the context of who she's talking to, as well. As it stands, humanity in Genshin Impact seem to have 12th century Era technology such as windmills. With this in mind, a time traveler can easily get away with fooling everyone, especially if they were keen on history before going back in time.

However, I would like to point out an interesting detail, that Mona fails to know Aether's future. If Aether turns out to be a hero with an large popularity, wouldn't have Mona at least have heard about his future accomplishments, let alone initially treating him with more reverence? There's a possibility that I could be approaching something that can potentially shift the storyline of Genshin Impact if I'm correct.







This is the first chart. Everything Mona knows about the past is based on an undisturbed timeline, assuming no one travelled back in time to a time before she travelled. If Aether was a well-renowned hero, why didn't she know?




If Aether and Lumine arrived, and by doing so causing a disturbance in history, it would make sense that Mona would know nothing about them, simply because she didn't live on a timeline where Aether or Lumine (depending on who you chose) became well-respected heroes.

On the other hand, let's say that Aether and Lumine were only geographically sent somewhere by the Unknown Goddess. If they were only geographically displaced, that means they didn't cause a new timeline to start, and in this context, it would make no sense for Mona as a time-traveler to not know anything about Aether, considering she traveled to a time where he would show up, if indeed Aether and Lumine were only sent to another world and not to the past.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/x7eajh/quest_to_talk_about_genshin_impact_part_14_mona/,Commentator289,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

I feel like this game's reward for your effort is bad, not the worst, i can confirm, but still bad. I played every day during the Yoimiya banner and the end of Kazuha and Klees, done all the quests i could and got all the primos available, i also played duirng the entirety of this banner as well, but that only amounted to around 110 wishes.

Now, it s obvious, i lost the 50 50, and i wish i could elaborate on why making the players have to gamble not only getting a 5 star, but also making a gamble If they get it or not, but that would be too long.

It s just that i dislike games where daily effort is required, and the reward isn t as great as advertised, and also as school is starting, it s getting harder to see If i can implement this game into my routine anymore.

Yeah, Zhongli isn t needed to complete all the ingame content, and i could just dodge like i always did, but that is not the point. In general, new characters are wanted or needed in order to get a better game progress and have a smoother experience.

And also, If y all ask me If i did the abyss for primos, all i can say is that cannot deal dmg fast enough because of how much i have to dodge the enemies before i get my burst combo started, and my characters are also badly build due to a lack of weapons.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/x7j4pq/is_my_mentaly_not_suited_for_this_game/,HiJoker,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

What makes her battle hard for me is that she barely takes any damage at all, her attacks are hard to dodge while also dealing big damage. And the most annoying part is that for some reason during the battle the passive freezing effect from dragonspine is happening (not sure why hoyoverse thought it was okay to put that in her battle) which makes my team take damage even if signora's attacks are dodged.

Arguably, their greatest achievement yet has been to use Pyro Slimes to heat water.




Unfortunately, looking at both Bing and Google Images for examples, this is the only example that I could find, nonetheless, you'll find this in game, so people will know what I'm talking about.

The overall point is, Hilichurls are heating up water with Pyro Slimes. Where it stands in terms of advancement, humans have teapots and windmills. To begin the industrial revolution, however, humanity needs to put, ""two and two together."" Humans already have turbines, as well as the idea that steam coming out of a teapot releases steam at a relatively fast rate. However, what they're missing is the knowledge that this could be replicated in large quantities to push turbines (like windmills, for the sake of simplicity).

I'm not quite sure how to draw a turbine myself, however, the overall point is, Pyro Slimes could be used to start the Industrial Revolution in Genshin Impact. Pyro Slimes burn grass where-ever they go and can re-charge if hit with water or Cyro. With Pyro Slimes, we wouldn't need to burn coal, because the Pyro Slime itself would be the fuel source, and what evaporates the water. This process would not pollute the water, either.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/x59nm1/quest_to_talk_about_genshin_impact_part_13/,Commentator289,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

I tried using this another website but to put it in simpler words this interactive map website sucks, compared to mapofgenshin, mapgenie doesn't have comments, they only show pictures for some Oculi, while mapofgenshin shows like small videos when clicking on the Oculi markers, which is incredibly useful but the worst of all is that mapgenie requires a premium subscription just to make more than 100+ tracks. I dislike paying for something when they're a better service available for free. sorry for this small rant. both of them have their ups and downs but the ups of mapofgenshin are more useful to me than the ups of mapgenie.

"Sat, Sep 03, 2022, 4:24:49 PM Coordinated Universal Time",Quest to talk about Genshin Impact Part 12: The General Time Era of Genshin Impact (Excluding the Fatui and Temples),"Without over-estimating, to determine how early Genshin Impact could be historically, I thought about the most recent technologies that exist in Genshin Impact, making the Fatui an outlier (of course).




The first detail that I would like to point out is that Samurai exist (at the bare minimum) in Genshin Impact. Because of Samurai, this places Genshin Impact, at the earliest, the 12th century, and this would be our first clue.




During a certain military conflict that happened in the game (I won't mention it just for the sake of avoiding spoilers), I noticed that individuals were only using bows, swords, and spears. However, in the game, we can see a few enemies that use fireworks as a weapon. I would presume, then, that in terms of human advancement, humans in Genshin Impact are at the equivalent to where humans were in real life during the 12th century, around right before they invented the cannons.

On Beidou's ship, we see Roman Ballestas. We learn later that these Ballestas had their arrows infused with some sort of magical properties, implying that, alongside the general advancement of technology, humanity is using magic in context of the Genshin Impact Universe, thus harnessing what resources they have around along with advancing in their own technologies.




In Mondstadt, we see windmills. Although to us they would give the ""general medieval village look,"" windmills have the function of crushing grain.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/x4yfsk/quest_to_talk_about_genshin_impact_part_12_the/,Commentator289,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

"Fri, Sep 02, 2022, 9:38:06 PM Coordinated Universal Time",Deep Lore Post 1: Paimon is the most powerful character in Genshin Impact Yet,"I’m going to start this series with the “Other,” flare instead of the “lore,” flare because the topics I plan to cover will sound so absurd that they will sound ironic, and because I want to keep talking about lore of the game, I can’t tag it as a “meme,” post, either. I’ll continue the other series for posts that sound less absurd than this one, but will continue this specific series with the ""Other,"" tag because of how outlandish these posts might sound.

To start the post to explain it better, I would like to review a hidden being in the game who I prefer to call, “Player Entity,” for lack of better words because it never visually appeared, but behaves like an Archon, and “Player Entity,” is the closest thing I would know of to the player itself without, “Breaking the Fourth Wall.” To understand Player Entity, the first sign of its existence goes all the way back to the first cutscene, but to understand the first cutscene best, you would have to watch both versions of the cutscene, i.e., choosing both Aether or Lumine. The cutscene in a historical sense plays differently depending on which character you choose. The Unknown goddess holds the two characters, but the moment you choose one of the characters, her attention is immediately caught, and she decides to deal with the character you choose first.

(Her reaction to the potential possession of Lumine, and therefore she decides to attack Lumine first)




(Her reaction to you potentially possessing Aether, therefore she attacks Aether first.)

When I talked about this the first time, I made a small mistake in understating what really happened. The Unknown goddess doesn’t just turn both eyes to look at you, she also turns her head a little towards you, despite not needing to use much of her effort nor power during the initial fight. Her attention, therefore, is completely off the sibling of your character, and she takes off such attention to make sure she deals with you (or the character Player Entity possesses) first, as though the sibling is not as significant of a threat compared to the threat your character would be in the moment of the possession. Historically in the context of that cutscene, Aether or Lumine didn’t do anything to catch the attention of the Unknown goddess, but nonetheless, no matter which of the two you choose as your first vessel, she will always look in your general direction, almost as though she sensed, “You,” to the degree she needed to turn her attention towards this change she sensed. Your presence being sensed, in summary, influences an event, so is somehow part of this universe.

As far as Aether, Lumine, and the Unknown goddess knew, there were only three people in that setting. Nonetheless, you watched the entire setting unfold. The Unknown goddess sensed you when you began to somewhat intervene and possess Aether or Lumine for the first time. Player Entity also seemed to help the character you chose because the character you chose reacted fast enough to let go of their weapon when it was being turned into cubes, but your character’s sibling didn’t seem to respond as fast as your character did, thus leaving them to be a victim to be torn apart and converted into this cube of condensed energy. The character you choose is the one to meet Paimon, regardless if you chose Aether or Lumine.

To speak further on player Entity before speaking on Paimon, because it’s important to understand the notion that Player Entity behaves similar to an archon.




In my second post talking about Genshin Impact, I explain how Player Entity behaves like an archon, especially due to the notion that it can take on an incarnation, similar to the archons, but just like Zhonghili, Player Entity can actually take on more than one incarnation, if not, many, and similar to how Venti explains that Venti is, “one of many,” incarnations of Barbatos, in that incarnations behave similar to disguises. Despite these many disguises, Aether (or your first character) is the only one of these incarnations uniquely located where you tell them to go. In the magic Teapot, you’re not going to find a double of your own character (the one you first choose), but such can happen if you take the form of someone else whilst also interacting with them in the magic teapot.

This point, finally, is half about Paimon and half about Player Entity.




Unlike certain menus where you “talk to someone,” in-game, your character doesn’t turn their head to face Paimon, and neither does Paimon face your character, but rather, something unique is happening. As explained before in different posts, pausing to the menu screen doesn’t stop time itself, neither does it freeze the universe. Rather, Player Entity’s perception of time becomes so slow that everything (Except Paimon) comes to a stand-still. Player Entity has, “stopped,” to observe time in a single point in time. This occurrence even happens whilst your character is gliding. Your character is seemingly frozen mid-air. However, nothing in space-time stopped, it’s just observing time from a single point. Because Aether is frozen, too, he can’t be the one speaking to Paimon. The human brain runs its calculations and mental processes fire within the brain, but this all occurs within the context of space-time, no matter how fast the normal human brain is processing, implying this happens with the normal flow of time. An interesting detail whilst opening the menu is that you notice your character is frozen in place without any animation while Paimon isn;t, which to me, “drives home,” the idea that Paimon is actually experiencing time at a single point while Aether is bound to the linear flow of space-time. Furthermore, when we talk to N.P.C.s, enemies can still attack us, and background N.P.C.s continue to move around, implying the pause menu and talking to an N.P.C. is a different occurrence, especially with the flow of events. Furthermore, as I’ve said in other posts, Paimon is the only one we know of thus far that has the capability to override Player Entity’s control over our character, implying similar powers are at play, especially with the notion of time-passage.

To speak mostly on Paimon herself, now, I must also occasionally refer back to Player Entity because Player Entity is how we can understand Paimon the best.




This chart explains the various things that are bound to the flow of space-time (Light, Astronomical Bodies, the Archons, Aether and the rest of the Genshin Impact world), and Paimon and Player Entity’s relationship to Aether as well as each-other.

Player Entity and Paimon are very similar in their powers, nonetheless, Paimon is much more powerful because she can overpower our control of Aether, as well as be something beyond linear time while still having a physical form as well as being able to eat and manipulate physical objects. We know that Paimon isn’t Aether’s hallucination because other people can see and talk to Paimon, but more importantly, we know that she’s not an apparition or some type of ghost because unlike ghosts with their occasional abilities to manipulate objects, can eat physical food items.

As the title suggests, I will now talk about Paimon’s power scale, and this is the part of the post where things will begin to seem the most outlandish. To start, an important idea to compare this to is to explain projectiles. The whole point of why projectiles are as powerful as they are, whether they be an arrow or a cannonball, hinge upon the basis that they are fast-traveling objects.




A small mass, if it can accelerate an object, can bring forth much force on the basis it is moving fast enough.

What makes Paimon, “so deadly,” is the idea that, even though she is small, she can act beyond linear space-time, and so can her physical form. With these equations in mind, I would like to take the time to calculate what would happen if Paimon were to poke something (let alone punch it) at what would visually be, “full power.”




Because of Paimon being able to be beyond linear time, she would also be beyond the concept of speed, too. On the basis that Paimon has a mass above zero, going at an infinite speed, she could poke something and possibly destroy the universe, on the basis that an infinite force would cause such a ripple in space-time that it would cause a black hole. The level of absurdity with this post is the reason why I didn’t want to label it as a lore post, because to explain the potential of Paimon’s true power, we would have to divide by zero, which is something we can’t normally mathematically do to calculate something, but in the case of the infinite, these are the conclusions we can end up coming to.

To put this into perspective, even if Paimon was holding back, a simple poke could turn the Earth into a small star, since particles would be traveling so fast that they could be colliding with each-other and releasing energy like the Sun does. The Earth at the degree it would heat up would be hot enough to be a star, but then quickly evaporate itself into a supernova since it couldn’t contain this form for so long, assuming Paimon touching the Earth wouldn’t cause it to explode immediately.

With this in mind, I could also create a new power-scale that would compare the various things that exist in Genshin Impact.




With this in mind, I would conclude that Player Entity (You) is the second strongest thing in the Genshin Impact Universe, while Paimon is the first. For Paimon to consider helping in human affairs at all seems to show a great deal of humility, considering how she seems to befriend Aether. On the power scale, Aether would be lower than a germ compared to her, but nonetheless, she’s humble with befriending a mortal. Furthermore, if there are more beings like Paimon, ""out there,"" then this suggests that there is a rank higher on the power-scale than Archons, assuming that Paimon is something beyond an Archon, or is perhaps an archon of a higher order, such as potentially, ""The Archon of Time,"" if this is indeed what she is, being beyond time itself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/x4d7fp/deep_lore_post_1_paimon_is_the_most_powerful/,Commentator289,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

Foremost, I'm completely a f2p player, so naturally I can't afford constellation. And I've been playing for about a month and a half.

So right now the 3.0 Zhongli banner is available and in a few days Ganyu will be too. I have the pity all built up and everything. But I'm not sure who to pull for, I've heard they both are really good. I just can't decide who to pull for.




People say Zhongli is really easy to use, can fit into most teams and that his shield is the best one there is. But defense really isn't my thing, I'm into doing a crazy amount of damage at once. Which is why I'm hesitant to pull for him.




And as I mentioned before, I like doing big damage, and I've heard that is what Ganyu's good at. Also, she's extremely cute, and I've been simping for her since I've done her story quest, and I also don't have any cryo at all. Which is why I'm leaning more toward her. But I've also heard she doesn't have much HP and that I have to have a specific team to do big damage. Which is just unrealistic for me since I'm a f2p and I don't want to wait half my lifetime making a good team.




SO basically what I want to know is how useful Zhongli is and how f2p Ganyu is and if I still can do a lot of damage without much farming. Sorry if I wrote too much.

"Tue, Aug 30, 2022, 11:13:44 PM Coordinated Universal Time",I used to laugh at Zhongli's spending...and then today I ran out of Mora,"Y'see, I went on a spending binge that I guess was kind of unprecedented, after looking at how many characters I had and how few of them I'd leveled high enough to take on enemies at my current world level of 50. I'd already lowered the level once before and, knowing that doing it again would mean I'd miss out on better drops and other rewards, I decided to not only level my core team, but also to get at least a few others up there.

Having always made Mora faster than I spent it before and with over 600k to work with, I figured I'd be okay if I went around farming Blossoms Of Revelation, as well as leveling up talents and enhancing weapons and artifacts, AND converting the materials I got into better ones at the crafting bench...

....and before I know it, it tells me I can't afford any more. I was at like 5k and change.

""Huh, okay,"" I thought. ""Well, I made it before, I just have to get back to questing, following Seelies around, opening chests, doing the 4 commissions per day, etc.""

Finally I figured I'd made enough that I could go back to the Blossoms. After three of them, I had maybe 15 Hero's Wit and 30-some Adventurer's Experience, so I thought that I'd give Aether another level first. Done, cool. I had enough left over for Xiangling to level up, and I used a bunch of the XP books...and then the game said to me ""Dude, I'm not sure if you've been paying attention, but this costs Mora too, and you're out again."" (Slightly paraphrased.)

Since Wealth Blossoms also cost resin, I won't bother with those and I'll just get rich again the way I did before, while saving it this time. But, I thought it was a bit ironic, so I wrote about it here.

EDIT: Oh, btw, it was worth it with Mona.

I'm AR54, and have had no real trouble clearing anything in game, except Spiral Abyss which I don't really care about. I have only 1 character at A6 (Yoimiya), a bunch at A5 (like 16), only Yoimiya with her NA Talent at lv 8, and only a few weapons at level 80.

So sometimes I boot up the game and I have a bunch of resin and I have no clue what I even want to tackle first. Do I want to max the rest of Yoimiyas talents? Do I work for ascension for Zhongli or Kazuha or Yun Jin? Do I try to get Zhonglis talents up? Do I max out Rust for Yoimiya? And then I just end up wasting the resin on artifacts lol

I'm just curious if anyone else has ever felt like this, and if so, how do you usually handle it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/x1yi0l/analysis_paralysis/,ShadowGamingAndMusic,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

I'm still relatively new and don't know who's a hidden gem since I've never heard of 1/3 of my characters. If anyone can gives some advice on who I have that's good (I need an electro or two for example since I have non leveled up right now,) I would really appreciate it. Also if anyone has a recommended team for spiral abyss I would be interested in that too, I think I'm on floor 7 or 8.

My current team is the Anemo Traveler (leveled up his talents not knowing it wouldn't carry over to other elements but I find he's as good as anyone else on my team.), Yoimiya, Chongyun (main dps basically), and Noelle for healing/shield (Ik she isn't too popular but Noelle has carried me through a lot of difficult fights with her shield and healing ability.)

I often swap in Barbra and Bennett when necessary, but I only got Bennet to ascension 4 yesterday and Barb is still asc 3. My AR is 47 and most of my characters under level 80 are ascended but not leveled up.

Only other thing to say is if any characters here are especially fun to play, I find that equally valuable (Really enjoy rolling around as Sayu.)

its very hard to choose for me so here are my reasoning for each of them

kokomi:

i got tighnari with his signature weapon and for a bloom/hyperbloom team i heard that kokomi is the best hydro applicator

also i want kokomi for her healing so i dont have to have zhongli in every team

ganyu:

i have ganyu's signature weapon (amos)

also i want ganyu for her insane dmg

for main dps characters i have hu tao, yoimiya, eula and the aforementioned tighnari

i also have xingqiu and yelan for possible hydro applicators

(im telling these so you have a better understanding of what characters would i need)

normally i wouldnt have even considered kokomi but with the new dendro reactions im torn (if i got kokomi i wouldnt pull for her weapon)

please help me cuz i just dont know

i wont be spending money so theres very low possibility of getting both of them",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/x0sseu/who_should_i_choose_ganyu_or_kokomi/,Kanacchi1023,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

"Sun, Aug 28, 2022, 11:01:01 PM Coordinated Universal Time",My honest review of Genshin.,"I stopped playing Genshin a few months ago and that made me want to create a detailed review to pinpoint exactly why I stopped. Of course these are just my opinions, I'm not trying to sound like a hater and I don't want to make anyone feel bad for still liking the game. These are just my thoughts. So here we go.

Story: 5/10 Genshin Impact's main storyline certainly isn't bad but it's nothing incredible either. Each of the 7 archons have their own quest line which mainly serve the purpose of leading the player through the different regions of the map and meeting the characters in them. The characters really shine in Genshin and most of them have interesting backstories that are fun to learn about although I feel like many characters are never used to their full potential. The main story has some unique plot points that keep you interested but also very low points where nothing is really happening and many of the quests are filled with bland dialog.

Combat: 4/10 Throughout the early game, combat is pretty fun. Experimenting with different elements and seeing how they react with each other feels engaging. Each character has a basic and charged attack plus their skill and their burst, nothing too complex. The issues arise in the late game when enemies start having much higher health pools and the only way to consistently defeat them is with elemental reactions and massive crit damage. Eventually it starts to get old when you realize that all there really is to the combat is spamming basic attacks that don't do any damage until your skills are ready to activate then rinse and repeat.

Visuals: 8/10 Genshin has very beautiful visuals and good art direction. The cell-shaded anime art style really pops and brings a lot of life into the game's world and everything has a very crisp look to it on max settings. Character designs are great and very memorable although they could do with a little diversity. Abilities and other effects are vibrant and have a lot of style. Occasionally you'll find a texture or model that reminds you that this is a mobile game, but those aren't frequent enough to take away from the overall great visuals.

Gameplay: 3/10 Obviously there is a comparison to be made between Genshin and Zelda botw although the two games aren't nearly as similar as some like to think. However, when it comes to the aspects that the games do share, Genshin generally does all of them worse. Movement is pretty standard: run, jump, climb, glide. While the movement mechanics are fine on their own, they are weighed down by the annoying, slow to recharge stamina bar. Besides exploration and combat, the only other prominent gameplay consists of gathering materials, fishing, and cooking, and none of these features are engaging at all.

Progression: 2/10 Progressing anything in this game feels tedious and unrewarding. You want a little more stamina? Go gather 100 collectables scattered across the map. You want to level up your character? Grind this one activity every day for a week straight. The worst part about this is that there's so many things you need to grind for if you want your characters to be good but there's also an energy system limiting the amount of things you're able to do in a day. Even if you actually wanted to spend hours grinding a certain material you couldn't. And one final thing to top off this games messy progression is rng. Even if you are finally rewarded with an artifact from the set you needed, 99% of the time it's going to be worthless. Every stat on an artifact is random and every stat that gets leveled up when leveling an artifact is also random meaning that a seemingly good artifact with only one bad stat could be rendered entirely useless by the rng leveling system.

Replay Value: 2/10 Genshin doesn't have much to offer when it comes to repayable content. Well, at least not fun repayable content. Sure, you can do your daily activities which are basically just chores or you can grind domains for artifacts, but what else is there to do after you're caught up on the story?

Crickets chirping

Well... there's abyss which is a mode designed to test the strength of your characters but it's really just combat scenarios where the enemies have much bigger health bars than usual. The only thing that ever really motivated me to come back to this game were a few limited time events but even those are hit or miss. Some of them add new story content and let you learn more about some of the characters which I enjoyed. Others would usually just be centered around a very basic mini game that gets old quickly.

Quests/Levels: 1/10 This is one of the lowest points in the game for me. Something about the way quests are formatted in this game makes them feel so dragged out and slow. I enjoy dialog-heavy games when said dialog is interesting but Genshin has SO much bland and unnecessary dialog. My biggest problem is that characters will constantly stop to talk to you during a quest just to spend minutes explaining the most basic things to the player over and over. There is so much quest dialoge that adds nothing to the experience of the story. Most quests consist of walking from point A to point B then talking to a character. There is some combat but it's never very challenging.

Music: 7/10 Genshin has a very solid soundtrack. The music while exploring is peaceful and always does a good job of reflecting the environment of the region you are exploring. Combat music is intense and some of the boss fight themes really impressed me. I really enjoy the frequent use of traditional instruments paired with more modern music.

Monetization: 1/10 This is a gacha game so of course it wants you to spend money at any given chance. To put it simply, if you want to unlock a character or weapon in this game you either have to get extremely lucky or spend money, that's really all there is to it.

Overall: 3.6/10

I think that Genshin Impact has more potential than it does actual quality. It could be a great game but I truly don't believe Hoyoverse will ever take the necessary steps to get it to that point.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/x08qc8/my_honest_review_of_genshin/,Sentient_Rose,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

"Sun, Aug 28, 2022, 6:24:01 AM Coordinated Universal Time",Why Bother Sharing Your Account?,"I love and hate Genshin. I play it on and off due to constantly getting burnt out from the game. I currently have quit and don't really care about what new content the game has to offer. This post is mostly me just complaining about people wanting to get on my genshin account so click away to a different post if this sounds boring to you.

My friends who know that I quit still play the game and won't stop bothering me about ""Boosting my account"". They've asked me this question before I quit the game and they still continue to ask long after I've quit Genshin. These players range from adventure rank 30 all the way up to ar58. So I've got a question to people who ""boost/share"" accounts, or straight up want to go on your friends genshin account. Why even bother?

My answer to my friends is that I've just told them a flat out no to sharing my account. yet they're adamant that I'll share it with them so that's why I've come to reddit to vent my frustration.

Here's a compilation of reasons why I should share my account with them

1.They can play while I'm asleep so my account is always active and making progress resource/story wise 2.They can use my resin and farm for resources (I know basically the same thing as reason 1) 3.You've quit the game so I can continue to make progress on your account. You won't play anyways. 4.When you return to the game you'll have a ton of new characters and weapons 5.My other friends lent me their account. Why won't you? It's kind of selfish.

All of these reasons don't interest me whatsoever. My account is already at a decent enough state, so why would I want you to boost my account?

The first two questions were from back when I still played the game, 3 & 4 are obviously the more recent questions. Let me tackle each question and answer for the millionth time on why I wont give you my account. (No comment on reason 5)

Reason 1 Why would I want that? I play the game to farm resources, get my characters built, and to enjoy the story. You're literally just playing the game for me so when I wake up the next day, I'll have no resin to spend and no story quests to play through. I login to legit nothing. I can't do anything.

Reason 2 Same thing as question one. I won't have any resin to use when I wake up.

Reason 3 There's a reason why I quit the game If someone quits a game, that might mean they no longer enjoy playing the game. And in my case, that's exactly why I quit. Why would I give a damn about any sort of progress my account will make while I'm gone? Yeah I won't be playing, but it's my account. Not yours. Why can't you understand that?

Reason 4 This is implying that you'll be pulling the gacha on my account Hell no. I pull for characters that I either want on my account because I like their design, and work well with my teams, or are just top tier characters. What you'll end up doing is pulling for characters YOU want. And when I return to the game, I'll most likely have all these characters that won't work well with anyone that I currently have. Once again, I quit so I don't care about getting any more characters. Also, when I return to my ""boosted"" account, everything about it will most likely be different. Artifacts, weapons, resources whatever else. When I return to a game, I want it to be exactly the same so I can pick up right where I left off.

Reason 5 Hello what? Yeah cool your friends lent you their account. Kudos to them. It's theirs. They can do what they want with it, and they chose to give it to you. I don't. I've explained to you why I don't like sharing my account but that's selfish I guess. Also you're legit gaslighting me here.

I've given these answers to each of their reasonings and it's like it goes in through one ear and out through the other.

It's so infuriating. These players asking for my account are genuinely nice people (most of them at least), but they're so desperate to play on my account for whatever reason. You already have a better account than mine, or are no where near the amount of progress my account has compared to yours. So why do you want to play on it? ""I juSt wANt to heLp"". Yeah okay, but for what feels like the millionth time saying this (to myself at least, I don't have the balls to say it to their faces), I quit for a reason. I don't enjoy the game. Why would I want your help for a game I don't like playing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/wzogro/why_bother_sharing_your_account/,Historical_Form_7533,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

During my previous post, I labeled the idea of an alien cult around the archons as too far-fetched and said I rejected the idea. However, before I went to sleep I thought about how Celestia looks peculiarly like a disguised mother ship. Furthermore, Celestia doesn't seem to be, ""Heaven,"" because it's relatively small to be the entire, ""City of Heaven."" Furthermore, the Gnosis are the Archon's, ""Connection,"" to Celestia.




This was my attempt at drawing what could be, ""Celestia,"" if it was indeed a mother ship.

This is not to say that if this stands true that all of the Archon's and elemental wielder's powers are all scientific. The Archons, if they are aliens, could also be a highly technologically as well as spiritually advanced race that might have come to this planet to help enlighten humanity. To my understanding, humans can also become archons, which implies that humans can be deified, but someone had to show them first.




""Celestial,"" doesn't always have to mean a spiritual, because in the name itself, it could also be referring to extra-terrestrials.




Aether was powerful indeed, and also had wings. Nonetheless, he was not an archon. Though, to a civilization that doesn't know any better, he could easily pose as one.




In the opening cutscene, the unknown goddess's portal behaves similar to a heart monitor with wave-like motion.

"Sat, Aug 27, 2022, 6:12:26 AM Coordinated Universal Time","Quest to Talk about Genshin Impact Part 7: A saltless ocean (or adapted plants), the idea that Aether and Lumine have travelled various, ""worlds,"" but are now trapped in this specific one, and Temples","Thus far, (and I put a small map to rid the chance of spoilers) to my understanding, major rivers in Genshin Impact connect to the ocean. Furthermore, salt-water is usually dangerous to non-land plants such as grass and weeds. Notwithstanding, looking at the topography, there is plant life growing alongside the shorelines of these rivers, despite being connected to the ocean. A counter-point would be on the basis that this plant life has adapted to handling salt water, but I don't think there would be any information on this. In either case, the plants' relation to the ocean of Genshin Impact points towards a situation that implies that this isn't Earth.

In the opening cutscene, it's explained that Aether and Lumine have ventured various, ""worlds."" However, a problem in understanding might arise because of how vague the word, ""World,"" can be. When we say today, ""the whole world,"" we're referring to Earth. America, nonetheless, is called the ""New World."" If you've lived in a cave and then suddenly saw the outside, to you, it would be a whole new world. Beyond the doors of our house, we call it the, ""outside world,"" and this can be applicable to the situation of the Magic Tea-Pot because there's actually a, ""World,"" inside there.

Assuming extra-dimensional travel exists in the universe (everything there is) of Genshin Impact, Aether and Lumine could actually be leaving and travelling to various third-dimensional plains, thus venturing into many ""worlds,"" as well, and this could keep going depending on what direction is travelled extra-dimensionally but leaves potential for an infinite amount of overlapping third dimensional plains. The word, ""World,"" is left open to interpretation. Thankfully for Aether and Lumine, the ""world,"" they end up stuck in is a habitable planet (I can't assume too quickly that it's Earth) where almost everyone seems to speak a universal language, and the idea that almost everyone speaks the same language doesn't change when you set your language settings to something else, which doesn't ultimately matter.




Similar to the Magic Tea Pot, some Temples in Genshin Impact seem to be these pocket-dimensions. Unless there's an extreme bend in space-time, if you go into an underground Temple, you shouldn't be able to look up and see the Sun, let alone a sky (but there's floating Islands so you can't really judge too much). Nonetheless, you can go into a temple and look up to see a sky as well as the occasional sun. With all this in mind, I'm lead to believe that who-ever built these temples were highly technologically advanced and/or figured out how to compress space in such a way that they can fit an entire world into a temple built connecting to a small hill. The Adeptus can perform space compression in the example of the tea-pot, but then there is also highly technologically advanced machinery that exists inside as well as outside of these temples, far more advanced than the humans we see on the surface.

Despite the grand displays of magic, humans are at least in the medieval age. By contrast, who-ever built the Guardians and the temples seem to be more advanced than modern technology we see in real life, but furthermore, if these temples are ancient and the guardians are ancient (they have been stationary for so long that there's severe signs of rust, also small trees have sprouted on them, and sometimes we see moss growing on them), it would make sense that humans aren't the only civilization that inhabited that specific world.

However, to assume that advanced aliens arrived on the Genshin Impact world's planet is a little far-fetched because we never see crashed spacecraft. Furthermore, electro users at least understand (or have some form of basic understanding) that electricity can power certain devices in the temples that can cause them to move, also Lisa understands that electricity in water is harmful to those who touch it.

Before making this post, I had some ideas that I personally rejected because of their lack of explanation or commentary, but if you would be interested, you can potentially look further into these claims that I don't plan to defend because I rejected them anyway.

(Rejected Idea #1) Aether and Lumine are aliens.

When you look at N.P.C.'s in Genshin Impact, you'll notice that Aether's eyes are massive and that N.P.C.'s by contrast are smaller. This can be explained away by the idea that Genshin Impact is an anime-styled game, but at the same time, the eyes of the characters are abnormally large in comparison to the N.P.C.'s. Furthermore, in the opening cutscene, Aether and Lumine were flying with wings. If they're flying with normal physics, it seems to imply that Aether and Lumine have hollow bones like birds that will allow them to fly, and they originally resided in a post-effort society where muscles are becoming increasingly useless, so humans genetically modified themselves to have larger eyes for looking at screens better and hollow bones that will enable them to fly like birds. Their lack of muscle and bone strength would be compensated by the ability to fly, as well as the ability to, ""work smart instead of hard.""

(Rejected Idea #2) The archons are aliens and formed a cult around worshipping them.

If the Gnosis and visions that enable people's powers are actual pieces of technology rather than magical items, it would make sense that people during the medieval age would mistakenly believe that these aliens are archons.

(Rejected Idea #3) Amber is lying about her experience in the Knights of Favonius.

While it could be just a build issue, Amber remains the weakest character in my party (I only use the starting characters on the exception of using someone else when a puzzle that requires a certain element needs to be solved). Furthermore, there's a quest where Jean passes out from exhaustion and seems to get sick from over-working herself/stress, some of the requests given are mundane tasks, almost as though she's doing most of everything herself (similar to Aether).

This is a rejected idea, of course, but I am quite puzzled that Amber isn't leveled up upon meeting her, given she's supposedly well-experienced and has been with the group for a decent time. Furthermore, it takes a while for her to pull an arrow back, and every second counts in the situation of combat.

(Rejected Idea #4) The Ocean isn't salt-water because the archon of salt passed away.

In the plot, there was an archon of salt, but because I don't want to spoil any deep details, I'll leave it at that regarding the plot, but then I thought for a moment that this would explain why the rivers can be connected to the oceans and still support plant life.

(Rejected Idea #5) Genshin Impact takes place in the Philipenes owned by Japan in an alternate timeline thousands of years in the future

Rome fell in the Fourth Century, and (according to Bing) Samurai lived in the 12th Century up until the 18th century. Words can potentially be subjective as to what we apply them to, especially in a different universe, but the word, ""Ballista,"" is used as well as, ""Samurai.""




The closest I could find that somewhat looks like a place where Samurai would be that resembles the Genshin Impact map would be the Philippines.

Please take this with a grain of salt because I rejected this idea, but it seems that, if somehow Genshin Impact takes place on Earth when there are still Samurai, it would seem that Genshin Impact takes place in an alternate history where Samurai still exist, Rome was at least around to make familiar with the word, ""Ballista,"" and that Ei/Raiden Shogun ruled over Inazuma, which would be some form of equivalent to the smaller Pilipino Islands, which by thousands of years of continental drifts and Earthquakes (Archons exist, so they can cause Earthquakes or potentially move the Earth on purpose) would potentially move eastward to the main southern Island which seems to resemble Genshin Impact's Main-land if the Island split in half and the ocean filled where it separated, as well as the eastern Peninsula of the largest Island turning counter-clockwise on the map and facing east rather than south.

Potentially, there could be Samurai without it necessarily being part of Japan, since Raiden Shogun has Samurai, but this is at least a Japanese-influenced vocational status in terms of the names of warriors, and considering Japan is close to the Philippines, there could be an alternate history in Genshin Impact where Japan took over and thereby annexing the Philipine Islands.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/wyvbz3/quest_to_talk_about_genshin_impact_part_7_a/,Commentator289,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

"Fri, Aug 26, 2022, 8:08:49 PM Coordinated Universal Time",Quest to talk about Genshin Impact Part 6: Player Entity and Unknown Goddess,"In Post 2, I spoke about the idea that Player Entity controls Aether or Lumine directly, in such a way that Lumine or Aether don't appear visually anywhere where Player Entity didn't tell them to. I also spoke about the exchange of forms and the various ways Player Entity can receive a form.

In post 4 and 5, I focused on the idea of parallel timelines due to Player Entity making its first choice on who to incarnate as initially, and that Paimon seems to experience time the same way we do and can even override our control over the character.

Today I'll be focusing once more on the initial cutscene, I.E., the fight between the Unknown Goddess against Aether and Lumine. When we, ""choose our character,"" so to speak, if you watch both versions of the cutscene on YouTube, who we ""Pick to be our first character,"" is the first one the Unkown Goddess chooses to attack.




(Unknown Goddess shifts her eye at Lumine when you choose her and attacks her first)




(Unknown Goddess shifts her eye at Aether when you choose him and attacks him first)

This is somewhat of a really curious case. The Unknown Goddess in this scenario was originally fighting Aether and Lumine in such a way that she could be rather casual about it. Although she didn't need to, when you ""choose,"" one of the two characters to be Player Entity's first incarnation, something seems to genuinely catch the attention of the unknown Goddess, so much so that she turns both eyes to look at you specifically, despite dealing with two threats at once.

(For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to talk in the sense that assumes you chose Aether)

Turning both eyes to look at you specifically has somewhat great significance. She turned her eyes in such a way that she sensed that something that wasn't there before now has something to do with Aether, and so much so that she can turn her eyes off Lumine as though Lumine is not any kind of significant threat to her. Aether and Lumine were equal in power and equally as a threat to the Unknown Goddess until something changed. Whether you choose Aether or Lumine, the unknown Goddess looks in your general direction, and not just glances, but turns both eyes specifically towards you, and chooses to deal with you first as though Aether is a greater threat than Lumine, although he isn't.

To my belief, this would be the first evidence of the Player Entity, which is also an unknown force to everyone except for the Unknown Goddess, who at least sensed your presence to a degree, but this possession happened (In relative Genshin Impact time) quicker than a second.

The Unknown Goddess's response to the possession of Aether points towards the idea that someone or something that is transcendent is influencing the material realm.

Going off of memory from watching the cutscene again, Unknown Goddess calls herself the sustainer of Heavenly principles. Despite this, Player Entity managed to be part of the action, and apart from the quick glance to the eye, you were completely undetected, because the Unknown Goddess would have tried looking for a third presence in that fight (The Player Entity).




To summarize, the attention of the Unknown Goddess was grabbed after she potentially sensed your possession of either character. Otherwise, she didn't really use much of her own skill and even looked bored during the fight, but for her to quickly move her eye to your direction definitely means something. She showed no fear nor startle, but she nonetheless gazed her attention as though something quickly changed about the situation.

Thus far, Paimon and the Unknown Goddess seem to be the only people that have a general idea about your presence, while this seems to be a secret to even the Archons since no one seems to comment about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/wyixaa/quest_to_talk_about_genshin_impact_part_6_player/,Commentator289,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

"Fri, Aug 26, 2022, 4:27:04 PM Coordinated Universal Time",Quest to talk about Genshin Impact Part 5: Player Entity and Paimon,"In posts 2 and four if I remember correctly, I spoke about Player Entity as behaving like an archon, taking the forms of many, and even taking the forms of the incarnations of Archons. My favorite point that I like to go back to for understanding Player Entity almost the best is the idea that you choose who it will directly control, and thus it takes its first incarnation. In post 4, I spoke about the pause screen and the idea that time stops. Player Entity's choice, as discussed in post 4, collapses two possibilities into one reality, being outside of space time. However, specifically this time, I would like to explain what could be going on.




In this model, the flow of time actually never stops. Instead, Player Entity is a being beyond Genshin Impact's regular flow of time. We never see a history where Player Entity doesn't interact with Aether or Lumine because we're not given that option. With this in mind, Genshin Impact's setting is on a timeline where history was disturbed to go a certain way by something (or someone) that is beyond time-space.

With this out of the way, a topic I just thought of today is Paimon.




While in the pause menu, Paimon is the only one who seems to be still animated and moving. If you open the menu to talk to Paimon while gliding, the character you control freezes mid-air. However, once again, you didn't really freeze time, but you're experiencing time at a single point. Because Paimon is not frozen like your character, it implies that she operates by different rules than your character. Given that your character is frozen and how eye contact works, it really seems to imply that Paimon is talking to ""You,"" (or perhaps player Entity). After-all, Paimon is not looking at your character, and neither is your character talking to Paimon, but rather you're observing your character from a single point in time while Paimon is looking behind your character, preferably at you.

Paimon doesn't seem to ever talk about Player Entity, even though she experiences time the same way you do. She also doesn't seem to share the same will as player entity because Paimon wants to prevent you from going into the red area on the map. In that moment, Paimon has the ability to send your character off a cliff or keep them unable to escape a dangerous situation from a pursuing enemy. With this in mind, it seems as though Paimon has similar powers to you with controlling Aether or Lumine. Because you can send Aether off a cliff, and because Paimon can send Aether off a cliff, it would make sense that in neither case Aether or Lumine are acting out of free will.

The only time Aether ever seems to express individuality is the limitation of dialogue options. For example, I only really wanted to pick the polite options, but sometimes Aether only gives the option to say something rude (such as bully or be passive aggressive towards Paimon). It seems, then, that Aether has an array of dialogue options in his mind, but Player Entity is responsible for bringing them into fruition. It seems, then, that dialogue options are things floating around in Aether's mind, then player entity somehow pokes at his brain to make him say it.

If Player Entity is an unknown Archon that is beyond Genshin Impact's time, Paimon is keeping secrets from Aether by not telling him about us. Before making this post, I went through and thought about the possibility of Player Entity being Paimon, but then I rejected this because it's a little too far-fetched due to the map border example, and if this were true, Paimon is keeping a secret that she was actually there to witness the Unknown Goddess taking his sister, as well as the idea that Paimon is possessing him. If Player Entity is Paimon, it seems that Paimon is lonely and controls people like ventriloquist puppets, which means that Paimon is going insane and needs puppets without free-will to possess so that she can talk to herself through them. Then again, if we controlled Paimon, we wouldn't be experiencing the map border limitations, and neither would she take over the way she does.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/wydk65/quest_to_talk_about_genshin_impact_part_5_player/,Commentator289,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

To explain further, what I meant by, ""collapse,"" was, because the only event that can change whether Aether or his sister is taken by the Unkown goddess is whether you choose them, and this is no more or no less the case. With that being said, events play out either-or depending on who you as the player entity chooses, although you yourself didn't do anything to physically help either of the two, nor did you grant them any more power than they already had.

Both possibilities are equally there, but the only difference is your choice, even though ""You,"" aren't part of Genshin Impact's stream of space-time, but rather cause a disturbance that influenced history.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/wy0i62/quest_to_talk_about_genshin_impact_part_4_two/,Commentator289,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

"Fri, Aug 26, 2022, 10:21:52 AM Coordinated Universal Time",My Experience With Gensin,"THE BEGINNING At the beginning from 1.0 I’ve viewed the game nothing more than an exploration, adventure, story and quest driven game but I knew about the gacha mostly ignored it at the beginning.

I’ve immersed myself fully into the game loved listening to the music, loved exploring finding all the puzzles, chests points of interests and loved exploring the two region towns, reading the NPC stories doing the main story and character stories. I was having so much fun.

HOW IT WAS AND HOW IT IS NOW

But I knew I should leave some quests for later on and try to find a balance between grinding, gacha, story and exploring but still ran out of content so all was left was the grinding and gacha.

When I fought Dvalin, Tartaglia and the other smaller bosses for the first time it was immersive exciting and made me feel different emotions, now it’s boring repetitive and lost its touch.

Basically this applies to everything that I found immersive and exciting now its the opposite which completely sucks.

THE CONFLICT AND MY FEELINGS (BEFORE I LEFT THE GAME)

Right now I’m conflicted between should I just leave the game all together and after some years create new account and don’t care about the gacha and just finish the story when it’s done with just the beginning characters make them as strong as possible. But the other part of me still wants to continue this by collecting as much characters as I can grind and wait for content.

Even when dragonspine came out it just wasn’t the same anymore.

CONCLUSION Basically I think I’m burnt out I wanna leave the game and come back after few year but miss all events and all characters and other part wants to keep this grind up sigh.

WHAT I THINK THE GAME SHOULD’VE BEEN

It would’ve been amazing if Mihoyo created a fully complete AAA game that costed like £50-60 with all the regions complete, all the lore and characters in game. You would go through the story and get to play as all the characters at appropriate times in story and unlock them, if you wanted to play as certain characters you could go to the region they are in and call upon them, you would see them doing stuff they like in the world, you would level up ur skills like in an RPG, find loot in chests the same way but have areas that have more rare loot, only fight the unique bosses only once in the story, wouldn't have repetitive tasks and dialogue thats unnecessary in the game. Would’ve been an absolutely amazing game.

UPDATE

I made this post while back for another sub its been long time and I still feel the same but I'm planing on coming back on new account and replay story up to point I left off and try to collect all archons and other characters I like and try to take it easy as there's lots and lots of content to do now.

So I give you, A LIMITED TIME EVENT, in this event a researcher from the akademiya along with an eremite friend he knows have gathered a couple of animals that would be a great rideable mount, the main reason of the researcher would be to test the speeds of the animals and how plausible it would be to have them as additional carriers of good when traveling distant lands with the different amount of load they can carry.

Yes, a racing coop(or not) event, it will be hilarious, we get to ride the new cow thing from sumeru, a big hog(+ other animals), and characters we know will make an appearance.

Kaeya will be there, of course the cavalry captain wont miss an event where he can show off his riding skills. His involvement can be, something about intel from the treasure hoarders got from emerites about something something.

Dehya, she's hot and she can be the person who will talk to us about the event or she will be a person who helped rally the animals.

Cyno, he will be the keeper of peace in the area or something.

Alhaitam can be a grouch and tell cyno to shut the event down.

The event will be held in the sandy new area of sumeru, where the desert is vast and no mountains(probably) are constantly needed to be climbed. The event will end, when an emerite decides to bring a ruined gargoyle to ride as a mount in the race, it will cause chaos and destroy the area, we will fight it in the end.

Anyway that is just what I think is a way to have players enjoy what they requested, this idea will never be true tho so it can just be wishful thinking.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/wxd3p5/a_way_to_add_the_mount_system_in_genshin/,Preventomato,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

I was thinking there was some kind of magic ban like Inazuma being unreachable, but this time only applying to the kind of vision one gets. That would explain why we had to wait until Sumeru to get Sumeru characters.

If not that means that we can now get Dendro characters from other regions like Monstadt or Fontaine but storywise I would feel much more confortable if the only Dendro characters were from Sumeru.

I was weirded out so I logged on to my account on the hoyo verse website just to make sure. And it all worked out, but it was weird because when she logged in on her PS4, it showed a different uid and it also did on the website. I looked over all the details and it showed a different new ID on my account but it was still the same, nothing else was changed. My friends afraid now to play the opening cutscene and select the traveler because she's scared and so am I that all my data will delete. So anyone if you have any information to give me to resolve this issue, that would be greatly appreciated duders",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/wx9l0u/help_me_pls/,edgyboi-cota28,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

I opened a ticket to hoyoverse support to restore my account and after few days of sending and receiving evidence that i own the account they send me a ticket to again fill everything i have sent before to them and said it will take 20 working days to get an answer … and submitting the same ticket more than once will make the process of retrieving the account take more time.. so i was sure to fill the ticket correctly and submitted it once … i waited and waited checking my email for a whole month … and when the 20 working days finished and still nothing happened I send a reply and got no answer till now i kept sending reminders and i feel like I’m talking to a wall … i just feel sad how bad communication genshin impact have for their customers.. i hate the amount of time and money i spent just so it goes away like that … 2 way authentication and e-mail bind and my user name all was active .. even mobile .. “sigh”

I've been playing since day one with only a few days on which I didn't log in.I even made an alt account for the sole purpose of farming primogems. It was all fine till Inzauma came. But after it's release, I felt a bit tired of Genshin but decided to continue nonetheless. I slowly left the exploration and only did the dailies,events and artifacts. Eventually,it all came to only dailies in 2.8 as I didn't do the GAA as I felt very tired whenever I opened genshin. Now that it's over, I think I got the much needed break I should've gotten earlier.

Now my real question is,what about you all? How do you cope with this ""Getting tired"" thingy,or do you even get tired and bored of exploring/playing Genshin in the first place?

"Tue, Aug 23, 2022, 6:43:34 PM Coordinated Universal Time",Quest to talk about Genshin Impact Part #2 (Player-Entity focused and predictions on how rolls work),"Player Entity is a strange case because the Player Entity, even without an incarnation or someone to control, Player Entity still has the ability to change an event in time-space. (Can choose to take control of Aether or his sister).

Learning from comments from a previous post (part one of this series), Venti's incarnation behaves like a disguise. Player Entity, in the meantime, can take control of Venti's incarnation (or take the form of Venti) as well as many different people. (Sorry for not being able to find a picture example of this). With that being said, Player Entity seems to behave like an archon, but not in such a way that player entity feels pain when one of their many forms (playable characters) take damage.




I will attempt to explain this chart step by step.

You (the player) take control of Player Entity. However, Player Entity does not have a form of its own yet. You have to choose Player Entity's initial form. Once you've chosen one of the two initial characters, Player Entity controls Aether or his sister directly, and in such a way that Ather or his sister never appears in a place where Player Entity didn't tell them to go. Player Entity (for the sake of not having to mention his sister), apart from cutscenes is always in direct control of Aether apart from Aether's limited range of motion and limited voice lines.

Starting characters (Like Kaeya) can exist where Player Entity isn't. Player Entity can even take the form of Kaeya with Kaeya being in the same room as player entity (giving the illusion of two Kaeyas plural)

Characters you wish/roll for will sometimes let you borrow their form, but to have their forms permanently, you need to buy these forms in exchange for Primo gems.

Archons, in the meantime, somewhat work the same way but still in a fundamentally different way. When you roll for Venti, for example, you aren't taking Barbatos's form, but specifically the incarnation of Barbatos (Venti). This is why you can play as Venti but Venti could be in a different geographical location than player entity. Furthermore, you playing as Venti does not grant you sovereignty over the Amneo (wind) element. If Player Entity controlled Barbatos like it does Aether, this would be a situation that would allow you to have sovereignty over wind, being in control of the one who has sovereignty over it, but that's not the case.

With the starting characters, it seems as though they gave you their forms for ""free"" (without Primo Gems) which makes it different from the ones you roll for, hence I said, ""Taken by,"" but I'm not quite sure what the true case is since no one seems to be aware of Player Entity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/wvwkel/quest_to_talk_about_genshin_impact_part_2/,Commentator289,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact
"Wed, Aug 24, 2022, 4:08:13 AM Coordinated Universal Time","Quest to talk about Genshin Impact Part 3 (Elemental life forms, Elemental Wielders, Elemental bosses, and Elemental Archons)","If, by chance, you're a new player coming to Genshin Impact and you played Pokémon and gotten used to Pokémon mechanics, indeed you're going to run into some confusion.

If you use a water element on a Hilichurl that shoots fire arrows, you might ask,

""This enemy uses the fire element, so why isn't water critical to them?""

Also, if you come from a Pokémon background, indeed this will be a very valid question to ask because of your potential confusion.

Another confusion might arise, and that's specifically when you unlock Ei as a playable character.

""Why was Raiden Shogun immune to Electro, but Ei isn't?""

I will attempt to explain these problems with various charts.







If the images loaded correctly, that's swell, and hopefully the charts explain themselves. Just in case they don't, to summarize, the Elemental Energy can be wielded by someone, but that Element isn't a part of their being. Just because you can use Pyro, that doesn't mean you're immune to it, but there are some cases where the Elements give life to beings and are immune to their own element, but an opposing element can be fatal for them.

The Hilichurl Chieftan is a rare exception to this rule because it was mutated by the Electro rather than being initially a being created from it, and it's not an archon either, and because it's fused to it, the element is part of its life force unlike a mere wielder of it.

Archons are immune to their respective elements, but that doesn't imply that all of their incarnations will be, as they're not as direct, nor are they merged, but have a relationship with their respective elements similar to how wielders do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/ww9gf6/quest_to_talk_about_genshin_impact_part_3/,Commentator289,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact

All stats calculated from base lv 90 Zhongli and refinement 1 staff and vortex and keep in mind vortex extra passive works only if Zhongli on the field




859 - ATK staff of homa *Base hp = 14695* staff of homa passive = 20% = 2939 + 14695 = 17634 with 0.8% atk bonus = 141.072+859 = 1000.072 ATK

17634




859 * 49.6% = 426.064 + 859= 1285.064 ATK




859 *40% = 343.6 + 1285.064 = 1628.664







Staff = 1000.072 atk + 17634 HP if low health = 1176.412 ATK




Vortex = 1628.664 ATK + 14695 HP




Planet befall = 900% ATK + 33% max HP




Vortex = 1628.664*900% = 14657.976 + (14695*33%) = 4849.35 + 14657.976 = 19507.326




Staff = 1000.072 * 900% = 9000.648 + (17634*33%) = 5819.22 + 9000.648 = 14819.868




Staff low = 1176.412 *900% = 10587.708 + 5819.22 = 16406.928




*With crit*




Vortex = (Base crit dmg = 50%) 19507.326 *50% = 9753.663 + 19507.326 = 29260.989




Staff = 50%+ 66.2%= 116.2% * 14819.868 = 32040.554616




Staff low = 116.2 * 16406.928 = 19064.850336 = 35471.778336




Normal attack* (Using 100% scaling)




Vortext = 1.39% * 14695 = 204.2605 + 1628.664 = 1832.9245 *50% = 916.46225 + 1832.9245 = 2749.38675(With crit)




Staff = 1.39% *17634 = 245.1126 + 1000.072 = 1245.1846 *116.2% = 1446.9045052 + 1245.1846 = 2692.0891052(With crit)




Staff low =245.1126 + 1176.412 = 1421.5246*116.2% = 1651.8115852+1421.5246 = 3073.3361852(With crit)




Normal attack combining the hit from 1 to 4 scaling from *Level 10 rain of stone* which is (60.8+61.6+76.3+84.9 = 283.6%)




283.6% * 1628.664 = 4618.891104 + 14695*1.39%= 204.2605 + 4618.891104 = 4823.151604




283.6* 1176.412 = 3336.304432 + (17634*1.39%)= 245.1126+3336.304432 = 3581.417032







*Shield*




Base shield abs = 2712 + 23% max hp




Staff = 17634*23% = 4055.82+2712= 6767.82




Vortex = 14695*23% = 3379.85+2712 = 6091.85 *20%*Vortex passive*= 1218.37+6091.85 = 7310.22 (Keep in mind this passive buff works only if zhongli on field)

The way i see it, shield and damage is better on Vortex vanquisher the only way Staff is over damaging vortex is by using the extra crit dmg which is 66.2% which is more than half the dmg. So you decide which is better, i find without much crit rate, Vortex way better *Not support* Since vortex has a higher overall damage and shielding but only if its on field and only if it doesnt crit.

While staff of homa has less shield but more hp, works off field and deals more damage if it crit. But now if u come to have Same crit damage amount lets say 200% crit dmg on Zhongli both weapons = Vortex more damage.

But if u went to have same artifact that has crit dmg, the crit dmg with Staff 66.2% always help staff better, so i rly dont know which one actually is better at this point and no i seek DPS Zhongli not a supp. Trying to raise up Zhongli dmg overall not just physical but also his burst and elemental resonance.

"Tue, Aug 23, 2022, 7:00:06 AM Coordinated Universal Time",A Journey to talk about Genshin Impact Part 1 (I didn't pay attention to the cutscenes and I skipped over dialogue),"Introduction

I prefer to write about lore for videogames (Minecraft, Kirby, Legend of Zelda, and just newly Kingdom Hearts but I haven't gotten approval to post yet). I got into Genshin Impact because I beat Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and was really inspired to find a game like it that was free. I'm not implying that Genshin Impact is a rip-off, otherwise by that same logic any anime-styled open-world game is a rip off of Breath of the Wild which would be rather unfair. Nonetheless, I did dismiss Genshin Impact as being that one time. I enjoy writing about lore topics in general because I prefer to write large, in-depth essays, especially back in high school and college.







Talking point #1: Archon Statues are more powerful than the incarnations of the archons.




Archon statues as they stand are infinite sources of health, on the basis they continuously replenish. If an Archon faints/dies, that doesn't seem to affect the healing capabilities of the statues nor cease their functionality in any way whatsoever. If a person takes damage next to an archon statue and by chance, if this source of damage was continuously smaller than the rate at which the archon statues replenish their healing power, a person could be immortal (not counting old age) at least in terms of damage to the body from an oppressor.

An archon needing to go to their own statues for healing doesn't seem to make sense either because if the healing power is being drawn from the archon, this would mean the archon is healing themselves, but needing to traverse a distance in order to go to a very specific place where they need to heal. Going to an archon statue is much more resource efficient than eating, too, but it's important for an injured archon to eat or go to where their statues are to heal. (I recall a voice line from Ei/Raiden Shogun where they eat, but I suppose they were being a tourist in this situation so she just wanted to taste human food).

However, I recall a solution as to why this occurs. When Venti explains who he is, he (to my memory) uses the term, ""One of many incarnations,"" to describe himself.




In my wording, I prefer to be cautious. When I described the healing capabilities of the Archon statues, I said, ""Infinite,"" but not, ""Unlimited."" If a drinking fountain was infinite, you could drink water from it, then it could potentially have some form of cool-down, but nonetheless, the water will never run out. If a water fountain were unlimited, by contrast, that would have the potential to turn the 3rd dimension of the universe into a completely flooded infinite ocean immediately.

Likewise, the archon statues are limited by a cooldown. Being rather cautious about how much damage I take in game, I don't often find myself healing at the statues in the first place, which is why I often see them completely full for when I do need to heal or revive characters from them.

(Genshin Impact's) Barbatos is Venti and Venti is Barbatos, but only in personhood. Because Venti is an incarnation, this implies he is indeed Barbatos, but at the same time, if he's not the only incarnation, this imples that there are other incarnations that aren't Venti. On this basis, Venti doesn't inherit all of the power of Barbatos (because it seems the archons can be weaker or stronger than one another, therefore implying limitations in power) but indeed is Barbatos.

Venti, then, could indeed end up dying without effecting Barbatos because Venti is one of many incarnations. If the traditional ""Incarnation,"" ""made flesh,"" definition is used, it implies that you could defeat all of Barbatos's incarnations without doing anything to Barbatos himself, as he could potentially incarnate again (I'm not sure if that's how that works because I didn't read the dialogue and didn't watch most of the cutscenes).




(Addition): There could actually be stronger or weaker incarnations of Barbatos out there. However, the only one I'm familiar with is Venti. I don't actually know about the others, or if they were mentioned, but I remember Venti saying he's just one of the many incarnations.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GenshinImpact/comments/wvhsqb/a_journey_to_talk_about_genshin_impact_part_1_i/,Commentator289,NA,NA,NA,Genshin_Impact
